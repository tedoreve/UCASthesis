  Abstract                 = {Spectroscopy of the Crab Nebula along different slit directions reveals the three-dimensional structure of the optical nebula. On the basis of the linear radial expansion result first discovered by V. Trimble in 1968, we make a three-dimensional model of the optical emission. Results from a limited number of slit directions suggest that optical lines originate from a complicated array of wisps that are located in a rather thin shell pierced by a jet. The jet is certainly not prominent in optical emission lines, but the direction of the piercing is consistent with the direction of the X-ray and radio jet. The shell's effective radius is ~79", its thickness is about a third of the radius, and it is moving out with an average velocity of 1160 km s- 1.},

  Abstract                 = {The discovery of bright gamma-ray emission coincident with supernova remnant (SNR) W51C is reported using the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. W51C is a middle-aged remnant (~104 yr) with intense radio synchrotron emission in its shell and known to be interacting with a molecular cloud. The gamma-ray emission is spatially extended, broadly consistent with the radio and X-ray extent of SNR W51C. The energy spectrum in the 0.2-50 GeV band exhibits steepening toward high energies. The luminosity is greater than 1 × 1036 erg s-1 given the distance constraint of D > 5.5 kpc, which makes this object one of the most luminous gamma-ray sources in our Galaxy. The observed gamma-rays can be explained reasonably by a combination of efficient acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays at supernova shocks and shock-cloud interactions. The decay of neutral π mesons produced in hadronic collisions provides a plausible explanation for the gamma-ray emission. The product of the average gas density and the total energy content of the accelerated protons amounts to \bar{n}_HW_p ≃ 5× 10^{51} (D/6 kpc)^2 erg cm^{-3}. Electron density constraints from the radio and X-ray bands render it difficult to explain the LAT signal as due to inverse Compton scattering. The Fermi LAT source coincident with SNR W51C sheds new light on the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.},

  Abstract                 = {SS 433 is a binary system containing a supergiant star that is overflowing its Roche lobe with matter accreting onto a compact object (either a black hole or neutron star)1-3. Two jets of ionized matter with a bulk velocity of approximately 0.26c (where c is the speed of light in vacuum) extend from the binary, perpendicular to the line of sight, and terminate inside W50, a supernova remnant that is being distorted by the jets2,4-8. SS 433 differs from other microquasars (small-scale versions of quasars that are present within our own Galaxy) in that the accretion is believed to be super-Eddington9-11, and the luminosity of the system is about 1040 ergs per second2,9,12,13. The lobes of W50 in which the jets terminate, about 40 parsecs from the central source, are expected to accelerate charged particles, and indeed radio and X-ray emission consistent with electron synchrotron emission in a magnetic field have been observed14-16. At higher energies (greater than 100 gigaelectronvolts), the particle fluxes of γ-rays from X-ray hotspots around SS 433 have been reported as flux upper limits6,17-20. In this energy regime, it has been unclear whether the emission is dominated by electrons that are interacting with photons from the cosmic microwave background through inverse-Compton scattering or by protons that are interacting with the ambient gas. Here we report teraelectronvolt γ-ray observations of the SS 433/W50 system that spatially resolve the lobes. The teraelectronvolt emission is localized to structures in the lobes, far from the centre of the system where the jets are formed. We have measured photon energies of at least 25 teraelectronvolts, and these are certainly not Doppler-boosted, because of the viewing geometry. We conclude that the emission—from radio to teraelectronvolt energies—is consistent with a single population of electrons with energies extending to at least hundreds of teraelectronvolts in a magnetic field of about 16 microgauss.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first catalog of TeV gamma-ray sources realized with data from the newly completed High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC). It is the most sensitive wide field-of-view TeV telescope currently in operation, with a one-year survey sensitivity of ∼5%–10% of the flux of the Crab Nebula. With an instantaneous field of view >1.5 sr and >90% duty cycle, it continuously surveys and monitors the sky for gamma-ray energies between hundreds of GeV and tens of TeV. HAWC is located in Mexico, at a latitude of 19° N, and was completed in 2015 March. Here, we present the 2HWC catalog, which is the result of the first source search performed with the complete HAWC detector. Realized with 507 days of data, it represents the most sensitive TeV survey to date for such a large fraction of the sky. A total of 39 sources were detected, with an expected number of false detections of 0.5 due to background fluctuation. Out of these sources, 19 are new sources that are not associated with previously known TeV sources (association criteria: <0.°5 away). The source list, including the position measurement, spectrum measurement, and uncertainties, is reported, then each source is briefly discussed. Of the 2HWC associated sources, 10 are reported in TeVCat as PWN or SNR: 2 as blazars and the remaining eight as unidentified.},

Evidently most of the gas was swept out by one or more supernovae. I explored the stellar contents and ages of the region from visual double stars, spectroscopic doubles, single stars, open clusters, emission regions, X-ray stars, planetary nebulae, and pulsars. The bubble has three sub-regions. The region toward the galactic center has stars as early as O9.5 V and with ages of 2-4 M yr. It also has a pulsar (PSRJ1856-3754) with a spin-down age of 3.76 Myr. That pulsar is likely to be the remnant of the supernova that drove away most of the gas. The central lobe has stars as early as B7 V and therefore an age of about 160 Myr or less. The Pleiades lobe has stars as early as B3 and therefore an age of about 50 Myr. There are no obvious pulsars that resulted from the supernovae that cleared out those areas. As found previously by Welsh & Lallement, the bubble has five B stars along its perimeter that show high-temperature ions of O VI and C II along their lines of sight, confirming its high interstellar temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the third Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) source catalog (3FGL) of sources in the 100 MeV-300 GeV range. Based on the first 4 yr of science data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission, it is the deepest yet in this energy range. Relative to the Second Fermi LAT catalog, the 3FGL catalog incorporates twice as much data, as well as a number of analysis improvements, including improved calibrations at the event reconstruction level, an updated model for Galactic diffuse γ-ray emission, a refined procedure for source detection, and improved methods for associating LAT sources with potential counterparts at other wavelengths. The 3FGL catalog includes 3033 sources above 4σ significance, with source location regions, spectral properties, and monthly light curves for each. Of these, 78 are flagged as potentially being due to imperfections in the model for Galactic diffuse emission. Twenty-five sources are modeled explicitly as spatially extended, and overall 238 sources are considered as identified based on angular extent or correlated variability (periodic or otherwise) observed at other wavelengths. For 1010 sources we have not found plausible counterparts at other wavelengths. More than 1100 of the identified or associated sources are active galaxies of the blazar class; several other classes of non-blazar active galaxies are also represented in the 3FGL. Pulsars represent the largest Galactic source class. From source counts of Galactic sources we estimate that the contribution of unresolved sources to the Galactic diffuse emission is ˜3% at 1 GeV.},

  Abstract                 = {To uniformly determine the properties of supernova remnants (SNRs) at high energies, we have developed the first systematic survey at energies from 1 to 100 GeV using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Based on the spatial overlap of sources detected at GeV energies with SNRs known from radio surveys, we classify 30 sources as likely GeV SNRs. We also report 14 marginal associations and 245 flux upper limits. A mock catalog in which the positions of known remnants are scrambled in Galactic longitude allows us to determine an upper limit of 22% on the number of GeV candidates falsely identified as SNRs. We have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatial systematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a key component of all Galactic Fermi LAT analyses. By studying remnants uniformly in aggregate, we measure the GeV properties common to these objects and provide a crucial context for the detailed modeling of individual SNRs. Combining our GeV results with multiwavelength (MW) data, including radio, X-ray, and TeV, we demonstrate the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple models describing the GeV and radio emission from these objects. We model the GeV and MW emission from SNRs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution to observed Galactic cosmic rays.},

  Abstract                 = {Cosmic rays are particles (mostly protons) accelerated to relativistic speeds. Despite wide agreement that supernova remnants (SNRs) are the sources of galactic cosmic rays, unequivocal evidence for the acceleration of protons in these objects is still lacking. When accelerated protons encounter interstellar material, they produce neutral pions, which in turn decay into gamma rays. This offers a compelling way to detect the acceleration sites of protons. The identification of pion-decay gamma rays has been difficult because high-energy electrons also produce gamma rays via bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering. We detected the characteristic pion-decay feature in the gamma-ray spectra of two SNRs, IC 443 and W44, with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. This detection provides direct evidence that cosmic-ray protons are accelerated in SNRs.},

  Abstract                 = {The Crab Nebula has been observed by the HEGRA (High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy) stereoscopic system of imaging air Cerenkov telescopes (IACTs) for a total of ~200 hr during two observational campaigns: from 1997 September to 1998 March and from 1998 August to 1999 April. The recent detailed studies of system performance give an energy threshold and an energy resolution for γ-rays of 500 GeV and ~18%, respectively. The Crab energy spectrum was measured with the HEGRA IACT system in a very broad energy range up to 20 TeV, using observations at zenith angles up to 65°. The Crab data can be fitted in the energy range from 1 to 20 TeV by a simple power law, which yields dJγ/dE=(2.79+/-0.02+/- 0.5)×10-7(E/1 TeV)-2.59+/-0.03+/-0.05 photons m-2 s-1 TeV-1. The Crab Nebula energy spectrum, as measured with the HEGRA IACT system, agrees within 15% in the absolute scale and within 0.1 units in the power-law index with the latest measurements by the Whipple, CANGAROO, and CAT groups, consistent within the statistical and systematic errors quoted by the experiments. The pure power-law spectrum of TeV γ-rays from the Crab Nebula constrains the physics parameters of the nebula environment as well as the models of photon emission.},

  Abstract                 = {The Crab supernova remnant has been observed regularly with the stereoscopic system of five imaging air Cerenkov telescopes that was part of the High Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy (HEGRA) experiment. In total, close to 400 hr of useful data have been collected from 1997 to 2002. The differential energy spectrum of the combined data set can be approximated by a power law-type energy spectrum: dΦ/dE=Φ0(E/TeV)Γ, Φ0=(2.83+/-0.04stat+/-0.6sys)10-11 photons cm-2 s-1 TeV-1, and Γ=-2.62+/-0.02stat+/-0.05sys. The spectrum extends up to energies of 80 TeV and is well matched by model calculations in the framework of inverse Compton scattering of various seed photons in the nebula, including for the first time a recently detected compact emission region at millimeter wavelengths. The observed indications for a gradual steepening of the energy spectrum in data is expected in the inverse Compton emission model. The average magnetic field in the emitting volume is determined to be 161.6+/-0.8stat+/-18sys μG. The presence of protons in the nebula is not required to explain the observed flux, and upper limits on the injected power of protons are calculated to be as low as 20% of the total spin-down luminosity for bulk Lorentz factors of the wind in the range of 104-106. The position and size of the emission region have been studied over a wide range of energies. The position is shifted by 13" to the west of the pulsar, with a systematic uncertainty of 25". No significant shift in the position with energy is observed. The size of the emission region is constrained to be less than 2' at energies between 1 and 10 TeV. Above 30 TeV the size is constrained to be less than 3'. No indication of pulsed emission has been found, and upper limits in differential bins of energy have been calculated reaching typically 1%-3% of the unpulsed component.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: .The Crab nebula was observed with the HESS stereoscopic Cherenkov-telescope array between October 2003 and January 2005 for a total of 22.9 h (after data quality selection). This period of time partly overlapped with the commissioning phase of the experiment; observations were made with three operational telescopes in late 2003 and with the complete 4 telescope array in January-February 2004 and October 2004-January 2005. Aims: .Observations of the Crab nebula are discussed and used as an example to detail the flux and spectral analysis procedures of HESS. The results are used to evaluate the systematic uncertainties in HESS flux measurements. Methods: .The Crab nebula data are analysed using standard HESS analysis procedures, which are described in detail. The flux and spectrum of γ-rays from the source are calculated on run-by-run and monthly time-scales, and a correction is applied for long-term variations in the detector sensitivity. Comparisons of the measured flux and spectrum over the observation period, along with the results from a number of different analysis procedures are used to estimate systematic uncertainties in the measurements. Results: .The data, taken at a range of zenith angles between 45° and 65°, show a clear signal with over 7500 excess events. The energy spectrum is found to follow a power law with an exponential cutoff, with photon index Γ = 2.39 ± 0.03{stat} and cutoff energy Ec = (14.3 ± 2.1{stat}) TeV between 440 GeV and 40 TeV. The observed integral flux above 1 TeV is (2.26 ± 0.08{stat}) × 10-11 {cm-2 s-1}. The estimated systematic error on the flux measurement is estimated to be 20%, while the estimated systematic error on the spectral slope is 0.1.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on a survey of the inner part of the Galactic plane in very high energy gamma rays with the H.E.S.S. Cerenkov telescope system. The Galactic plane between +/-30° in longitude and +/-3° in latitude relative to the Galactic center was observed in 500 pointings for a total of 230 hr, reaching an average flux sensitivity of 2% of the Crab Nebula at energies above 200 GeV. Fourteen previously unknown sources were detected at a significance level greater than 4 σ after accounting for all trials involved in the search. Initial results on the eight most significant of these sources were already reported elsewhere (Aharonian and coworkers). Here we present detailed spectral and morphological information for all the new sources, along with a discussion on possible counterparts in other wavelength bands. The distribution in Galactic latitude of the detected sources appears to be consistent with a scale height in the Galactic disk for the parent population smaller than 100 pc, consistent with expectations for supernova remnants and/or pulsar wind nebulae.},

The angular resolution of ~0.06° (for events triggering three or four telescopes) and the large field of view of H.E.S.S. (5° diameter) are well adapted to studying the morphology of the object in very high energy gamma rays, which exhibits a remarkably thin shell very similar to the features observed in the radio range and in X-rays. The spectral analysis of the source from 300 GeV to 20 TeV is also presented. Finally, the possible origins of the very high energy gamma-ray emission (inverse Compton scattering by electrons or the decay of neutral pions produced by proton interactions) are discussed, on the basis of morphological and spectral features obtained at different wavelengths.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. The W51 complex hosts the supernova remnant W51C which is known to interact with the molecular clouds in the star forming region W51B. In addition, a possible pulsar wind nebula CXO J192318.5+140305 was found likely associated with the supernova remnant. Gamma-ray emission from this region was discovered by Fermi/LAT (between 0.2 and 50 GeV) and H.E.S.S. (>1 TeV). The spatial distribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of the emission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or the molecular cloud. However, the modeling of the spectral energy distribution presented by the Fermi/LAT collaboration suggests a hadronic emission mechanism. The possibility that the gamma-ray emission from such an object is of hadronic origin can contribute to solvingthe long-standing problem of the contribution to galactic cosmic rays by supernova remnants. Aims: Our aim is to determine the morphology of the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission of W51 and measure its spectral properties. Methods: We performed observations of the W51 complex with the MAGIC telescopes for more than 50 h. The energy range accessible with MAGIC extends from 50 GeV to several TeV, allowing for the first spectral measurement at these energies. In addition, the good angular resolution in the medium (few hundred GeV) to high (above 1 TeV) energies allow us to perform morphological studies. We look for underlying structures by means of detailed morphological studies. Multi-wavelength data from this source have been sampled to model the emission with both leptonic and hadronic processes. Results: We detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gamma rays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations. We extend the spectrum from the highest Fermi/LAT energies to ~5 TeV and find that it follows a single power law with an index of 2.58 ± 0.07stat ± 0.22syst. The main part of the emission coincides with the shocked cloud region, while we find a feature extending towards the pulsar wind nebula. The possible contribution of the pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence on energy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. The broad band spectral energy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies proton acceleration above 100 TeV. This result, together with the morphology of the source, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions in the interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud.},

  Abstract                 = {Using data from the all-sky Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite, we made a catalog of over 8000 Galactic H II regions and H II region candidates by searching for their characteristic mid-infrared (MIR) morphology. WISE has sufficient sensitivity to detect the MIR emission from H II regions located anywhere in the Galactic disk. We believe this is the most complete catalog yet of regions forming massive stars in the Milky Way. Of the ~8000 cataloged sources, ~1500 have measured radio recombination line (RRL) or Hα emission, and are thus known to be H II regions. This sample improves on previous efforts by resolving H II region complexes into multiple sources and by removing duplicate entries. There are ~2500 candidate H II regions in the catalog that are spatially coincident with radio continuum emission. Our group's previous RRL studies show that ~95% of such targets are H II regions. We find that ~500 of these candidates are also positionally associated with known H II region complexes, so the probability of their being bona fide H II regions is even higher. At the sensitivity limits of existing surveys, ~4000 catalog sources show no radio continuum emission. Using data from the literature, we find distances for ~1500 catalog sources, and molecular velocities for ~1500H II region candidates.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent advances in TeV gamma-ray astronomy are largely the result of the ability to differentiate between extensive air showers generated by gamma rays and hadronic cosmic rays. Air Cerenkov telescopes have developed and perfected the ``imaging'' technique over the past several decades. However, until now no background rejection method has been successfully used in an air shower array to detect a source of TeV gamma rays. We report on a method to differentiate hadronic air showers from electromagnetic air showers in the Milagro gamma-ray observatory, based on the ability to detect the energetic particles in an extensive air shower. The technique is used to detect TeV emission from the Crab Nebula. The flux from the Crab Nebula is estimated to be 2.68(+/-0.42stat+/-1.4sys)×10-7(E/1TeV)-2.59 m-2 s-1 TeV-1, where the spectral index is assumed to be as given by the HEGRA collaboration.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. CMB experiments aiming at a precise measurement of the CMB polarization, such as the Planck satellite, need a strong polarized absolute calibrator on the sky to accurately set the detectors polarization angle and the cross-polarization leakage. As the most intense polarized source in the microwave sky at angular scales of few arcminutes, the Crab nebula will be used for this purpose. Aims: Our goal was to measure the Crab nebula polarization characteristics at 90 GHz with unprecedented precision. Methods: The observations were carried out with the IRAM 30 m telescope employing the correlation polarimeter XPOL and using two orthogonally polarized receivers. Results: We processed the Stokes I, Q, and U maps from our observations in order to compute the polarization angle and linear polarization fraction. The first is almost constant in the region of maximum emission in polarization with a mean value of αSky = 152.1±0.3° in equatorial coordinates, and the second is found to reach a maximum of Π = 30% for the most polarized pixels. We find that a CMB experiment having a 5 arcmin circular beam will see a mean polarization angle of αSky = 149.9±0.2° and a mean polarization fraction of Π = 8.8±0.2%.},

  Abstract                 = {The equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) have been formulated as a hyperbolic system of conservation laws. In that form it becomes possible to use higher order Godunov schemes for their solution. This results in a robust and accurate solution strategy. However, the magnetic field also satisfies a constraint that requires its divergence to be zero at all times. This is a property that cannot be guaranteed in the zone centered discretizations that are favored in Godunov schemes without involving a divergence cleaning step. In this paper we present a staggered mesh strategy which directly uses the properly upwinded fluxes that are provided by a Godunov scheme. The process of directly using the upwinded fluxes relies on a duality that exists between the fluxes obtained from a higher order Godunov scheme and the electric fields in a plasma. By exploiting this duality we have been able to construct a higher order Godunov scheme that ensures that the magnetic field remains divergence-free up to the computer's round-off error. We have even presented a variant of the basic algorithm that uses multidimensional features in the flow to design an upwinded strategy that aligns itself with the predominant upwinded direction in the flow. We have devised several stringent test problems to show that the scheme works robustly and accurately in all situations. In doing so we have shown that a scheme that involves a collocation of magnetic field variables that is different from the one traditionally favored in the design of higher order Godunov schemes can nevertheless offer the same robust and accurate performance of higher order Godunov schemes provided the properly upwinded fluxes from the Godunov methodology are used in the scheme's construction.},

  Abstract                 = {ASCA discovered an extended source in the constellation Scutum. The X-ray morphology is an elliptical shape elongated from north to south with a mean diameter of about 10'. The image center is located at RA2000=18h43m53s,DEC2000=-03°52'55'' (hereafter, AX J1843.8-0352). The north and south rims of AX J1843.8-0352 are associated with non-thermal radio sources C and F of the G28.6-0.1 complex (Helfand et al. 1989, AAA49.125.029 ). The X-ray spectrum was fitted with a model of either a thin thermal plasma in non-equilibrium ionization of a temperature 5.4keV or a power-law of photon index 2.1. The absorption column is (2.4-4.0)×1022cm-2, which probably places this source in the Scutum arm. With a reasonable distance assumption of about 7kpc, we estimate the mean diameter and X-ray luminosity to be ~20pc and ~3×1034erg s-1, respectively. Although a Sedov solution for a thin thermal plasma model gives parameters of a young shell-like SNR, no strong emission lines are found with the metal abundances being ~ solar. Thus, a more likely scenario for both the radio and X-ray spectra and the morphologies is that AX J1843.8-0352 is a shell-like SNR which predominantly emits synchrotron X-rays.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the results of 1.3 mm observations of the Crab Nebula, performed with the MPIfR bolometer arrays at the IRAM 30-m telescope. The maps obtained, of unprecedented quality at these wavelengths, allow a direct comparison with high-resolution radio maps. Although the spatial structure of the Crab Nebula does not change much from radio to millimetre wavelengths, we have detected significant spatial variations of the spectral index between 20 cm and 1.3 mm. The main effect is a spectral flattening in the inner region, which can be hardly explained just in terms of the evolution of a single population of synchrotron emitting electrons. We propose instead that this is the result of the emergence of a second synchrotron component, that we have tried to extract from the data. Shape and size of this component resemble those of the Crab Nebula in X-rays. However, while the more compact structure of the Crab Nebula in X-rays is commonly regarded as an effect of synchrotron downgrading, it cannot be explained why a similar structure is present also at millimetre wavelengths, where the electron lifetimes far exceed the nebular age. Our data, combined with published upper limits on spatial variations of the radio spectral index, also imply a low-energy cutoff for the distribution of electrons responsible for this additional synchrotron component. Although no model has been developed so far to explain the details of this component, one may verify that the total number of the electrons responsible for it is in agreement with what predicted by the classical pulsar-wind models, which otherwise are known to fail in accounting for the number of radio emitting electrons. This numerical coincidence can give indications about the origin of this component. We have also detected a spectral steepening at millimetre wavelengths in some elongated regions, whose positions match those of radio synchrotron filaments. The steepening is taken as the indication that magnetic fields in synchrotron filaments are stronger than the average nebular field.

Argon-36 is believed to have originated from explosive nucleosynthesis in massive stars during core-collapse supernova events. Its detection in the Crab Nebula, the product of such a supernova event, confirms this expectation. The likely excitation mechanism for the observed 36ArH+ emission lines is electron collisions in partially ionized regions with electron densities of a few hundred per centimeter cubed.},

Observations with current and future facilities have the potential to illuminate the role of these magnetic fields play in the astrophysical processes of galaxy clusters. To obtain a greater understanding of how the initial seed fields evolve to the magnetic fields in the intracluster medium requires magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We critically assess the current smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamic (SPMHD) schemes, especially highlighting the impact of a hyperbolic divergence cleaning scheme and artificial resistivity switch on the magnetic field evolution in cosmological simulations of the formation of a galaxy cluster using the N-body/SPMHD code GCMHD++. The impact and performance of the cleaning scheme and two different schemes for the artificial resistivity switch is demonstrated via idealized test cases and cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that the hyperbolic divergence cleaning scheme is effective at suppressing the growth of the numerical divergence error of the magnetic field and should be applied to any SPMHD simulation. Although the artificial resistivity is important in the strong field regime, it can suppress the growth of the magnetic field in the weak field regime, such as galaxy clusters. With sufficient resolution, simulations with divergence cleaning can reproduce observed magnetic fields. We conclude that the cleaning scheme alone is sufficient for galaxy cluster simulations, but our results indicate that the SPMHD scheme must be carefully chosen depending on the regime of the magnetic field.},

It is argued, using earth's bow shock as an example, that a shock front produces large numbers of protons, and probably electrons also, which satisfy this condition. The resulting energy spectrum of these initially nonrelativistic particles is calculated. It yields an estimate of the density of cosmic-ray particles in a shocked gas and indicates that a large proportion of the random energy produced by a shock is given to accelerated particles. The synchrotron radio emission from the energetic electrons in a shocked gas is calculated, and the theoretical and observed flux densities of two supernova remnants (Tycho's SNR and Cas A) are compared and found to agree satisfactorily. The implications for the minimum energy of radio sources are considered, and the effect of multiple shocks on the cosmic-ray density evaluated.},

The set of empirical parameters, like distance, source size and total energy release, is the same which reproduces the dynamical properties of the SNR and the spectral characteristics of the emission produced by CRs. The extremely small spatial scales in the observed morphological structures at hard X-ray energies are due to a large effective magnetic field B_d˜ 500 μG in the interior which is at the same time not only required but also sufficient to achieve the excellent agreement between the spatially integrated radio and X-ray synchrotron spectra and their calculated form. The only reasonably thinkable condition for the production of such a large effective field strength is a very efficiently accelerated nuclear CR component. Therefore the Chandra data confirm first of all the inference that Cas A indeed accelerates nuclear CRs with the high efficiency required for Cas A to be considered as a member of the main class of Galactic CR sources and, secondly, that the nonlinear kinetic theory of CR acceleration in SNRs is a reliable method to determine the magnetic field value in SNRs.},

  Abstract                 = {We have analyzed the trajectories of moving stellar groups in the solar neighborhood in an attempt to estimate the number of supernova explosions in our local environment during the past 20 million years. Using Hipparcos stellar distances and the results of kinematical analyses by Asiain et al. (\cite{Asiain1999a}a) on the Pleiades moving groups, we are able to show that subgroup B1, consisting of early type B stars up to 10 Msun, but lacking more massive objects, has passed through the local interstellar medium within less than 100 pc. Comparing the stellar content of B1 with the initial mass function derived from the analysis of galactic OB associations, we estimate the number of supernova explosions and find that about 20 supernovae must have occurred during the past ~ 10 - 20 million years, which is suggested to be the age of the Local Bubble; the age of the star cluster is about ~ 20 - 30 million years. For the first time, this provides strong evidence that the Local Bubble must have been created and shaped by multi-supernova explosions and presumably been reheated more than 1 million years ago, consistent with recent findings of an excess of 60Fe in a deep ocean ferromanganese crust. Calculating similarity solutions of an expanding superbubble for time-dependent energy input, we show that the number of explosions is sufficient to explain the size of the Local Bubble. The present energy input rate is about dot ESN ~ 5 x 1036 erg/s, in good agreement with the estimated local soft X-ray photon output rate. It seems plausible that the origin of the Local Bubble is also linked to the formation of the Gould Belt, which originated about 30-60 Myrs ago.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. The past decade has witnessed a large number of Galactic plane surveys at angular resolutions below 20''. However, no comparable high-resolution survey exists at long radio wavelengths around 21 cm in line and continuum emission. Aims: We remedy this situation by studying the northern Galactic plane at 20'' resolution in emission of atomic, molecular, and ionized gas. Methods: Employing the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in the C-array configuration and a large program, we observe the HI 21 cm line, four OH lines, nineteen Hnα radio recombination lines as well as the continuum emission from 1 to 2 GHz in full polarization over a large part of the first Galactic quadrant. Results: Covering Galactic longitudes from 14.5 to 67.4 deg and latitudes between ± 1.25 deg, we image all of these lines and the continuum at 20'' resolution. These data allow us to study the various components of the interstellar medium (ISM): from the atomic phase, traced by the HI line, to the molecular phase, observed by the OH transitions, to the ionized medium, revealed by the cm continuum and the Hnα radio recombination lines. Furthermore, the polarized continuum emission enables magnetic field studies. In this overview paper, we discuss the survey outline and present the first data release as well as early results from the different datasets. We now release the first half of the survey; the second half will follow later after the ongoing data processing has been completed. The data in fits format (continuum images and line data cubes) can be accessed through the project web-page. Conclusions: The HI/OH/Recombination line survey of the Milky Way (THOR) opens a new window to the different parts of the ISM. It enables detailed studies of molecular cloud formation, conversion of atomic to molecular gas, and feedback from Hii regions as well as the magnetic field in the Milky Way. It is highly complementary to other surveys of our Galaxy, and comparing the different datasets will allow us to address many open questions.

  Abstract                 = {The rotation curve (RC) of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is constructed starting from its very inner regions (few hundred parsecs) out to a large galactocentric distance of ~200 kpc using kinematical data on a variety of tracer objects moving in the gravitational potential of the Galaxy, without assuming any theoretical models of the visible and dark matter (DM) components of the Galaxy. We study the effect on the RC due to the uncertainties in the values of the Galactic constants (GCs) R 0 and V 0 (these being the Sun's distance from and circular rotation speed around the Galactic center, respectively) and the velocity anisotropy parameter β of the halo tracer objects used for deriving the RC at large galactocentric distances. The resulting RC in the disk region is found to depend significantly on the choice of the GCs, while the dominant uncertainty in the RC at large distances beyond the stellar disk comes from the uncertainty in the value of β. In general we find that the mean RC steadily declines at distances beyond ~60 kpc, independently of the value of β. Also, at a given radius, the circular speed is lower for larger values of β (i.e., for more radially biased velocity anisotropy). Considering that the largest possible value of β is unity, which corresponds to stellar orbits being purely radial, our results for the case of β = 1 give a lower limit to the total mass of the Galaxy within ~200 kpc, M(200 kpc) >~ (6.8 ± 4.1) × 1011 M ⊙, independently of any model of the DM halo of the Galaxy.},

The velocity range of the images includes all the gas in the Sagittarius spiral arm. Color figures display the peak line brightness temperature, the velocity-integrated intensity, and 2 km s-1 channel-averaged maps for both isotopologs, and also the CO/13CO J = 2-1 line intensity ratio as a function of velocity. The CO and 13CO line intensity image cubes are made available in standard FITS format as electronically readable tables. We compare our molecular line maps with the 1.1 mm continuum image from the BOLOCAM Galactic Plane Survey. From our 13CO image cube, we derive kinematic information for the 99 BGPS sources in the mapped field in the form of Gaussian component fits. The integrated 13CO line intensity and the 1.1 mm source flux density show only a modest degree of correlation for the 99 sources, likely due to a range of dust and gas physical conditions within the sources. However, the 1.1 mm continuum surface brightness and the integrated 13CO line intensity for small regions containing single BGPS sources and molecular clouds show very good correlations in many cases. Differences in the shapes of these correlations from one spatial region to another probably result from different physical conditions or structure in the clouds.},

One radio wisp in particular can be unambiguously identified between two of our observing epochs and moves outward with an apparent velocity of ~0.24c. The similarity in both morphology and behavior of the present radio wisps to the optical wisps suggests that they are associated. This implies that the radio wisps, like the optical ones, are likely manifestations of the shock in the Crab pulsar's wind. This suggests that the radio-emitting electrons are accelerated in the same region as the ones responsible for the optical to X-ray emission, contrary to most current models.},

New data at 74 MHz are combined with data at 327 MHz, 1.5 GHz, and 5 GHz. In contrast to previous claims, little spatial variation in the spectral index is seen. In particular, between 327 MHz and 5 GHz we see no evidence of spectral steepening near the edge of the Nebula, the ``jet,'' or the ionized filaments. The rms limits on any spectral index variations in these regions amount to no more than 0.01. We believe that earlier reports of large steepening were the result of correlator bias and image registration problems. An elongated feature was detected 1' northwest of the pulsar, which may be a continuation of the well-known wisplike structures seen closer to the center of the Nebula. At 74 MHz, we see for the first time evidence of free-free absorption by the thermal material in the Crab Nebula's filaments. Apart from some possible renewed acceleration occurring in the wisps, the dominant accelerator of relativistic electrons in the Crab Nebula is the pulsar itself.},

  Abstract                 = {We carried out a large program with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA): "THOR: The H i, OH, Recombination line survey of the Milky Way". We observed a significant portion (~100 deg2) of the Galactic plane in the first quadrant of the Milky Way in the 21 cm H i line, 4 OH transitions, 19 radio recombination lines, and continuum from 1 to 2 GHz. In this paper we present a catalog of the continuum sources in the first half of the survey (l = 14.0-37.9° and l = 47.1-51.2°, | b | ≤ 1.1°) at a spatial resolution of 10-25″, depending on the frequency and sky position with a spatially varying noise level of ~0.3-1 mJy beam-1. The catalog contains ~4400 sources. Around 1200 of these are spatially resolved, and ~1000 are possible artifacts, given their low signal-to-noise ratios. Since the spatial distribution of the unresolved objects is evenly distributed and not confined to the Galactic plane, most of them are extragalactic. Thanks to the broad bandwidth of the observations from 1 to 2 GHz, we are able to determine a reliable spectral index for ~1800 sources. The spectral index distribution reveals a double-peaked profile with maxima at spectral indices of α ≈ -1 and α ≈ 0, corresponding to steep declining and flat spectra, respectively. This allows us to distinguish between thermal and non-thermal emission, which can be used to determine the nature of each source. We examine the spectral index of ~300 known H ii regions, for which we find thermal emission with spectral indices around α ≈ 0. In contrast, supernova remnants (SNR) show non-thermal emission with α ≈ -0.5 and extragalactic objects generally have a steeper spectral index of α ≈ -1. Using the spectral index information of the THOR survey, we investigate potential SNR candidates. We classify the radiation of four SNR candidates as non-thermal, and for the first time, we provide strong evidence for the SNR origin of these candidates.

We also present MIPS SED low-resolution spectra in the 55-95 μm region. The observed emission in the MIPS 24 μm band shows the entire shell. Emission in the MIPS 70 μm and IRAC 8 μm bands is seen only from the brightest regions of 24 μm emission, which also correspond to the regions seen in optical Hα images. Shorter wavelength IRAC images are increasingly dominated by stars, although faint filaments are discernible. The SED spectrum of shows a faint continuum dropping off to longer wavelengths and confirms that strong line emission does not dominate the mid-IR spectral region. The emission we see is due primarily to warm dust emission from dust heated by the primary blast wave; no excess infrared emission is observed in regions where supernova ejecta are seen in X-rays. We use models of the dust to interpret the observed 70/24 μm ratio and constrain the allowed range of temperatures and densities. We estimate the current mass of dust in the warm dust component to be 5.4×10-4 Msolar, and infer an original mass of about 3×10-3 Msolar before grain sputtering. The MIPS 160 μm band shows no emission belonging to the remnant. We place a conservative but temperature-dependent upper limit on any cold dust component roughly a factor of 10 below the cold dust mass inferred from SCUBA observations. Finally, we comment on issues relevant to the possible precursor star and the supernova type. Based on observations made with the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope.

Observations suggest that shock waves in different astrophysical environments accelerate cosmic rays efficiently. In the first order process, high energy particles diffuse through Alfvén waves that scatter them and couple them to the background plasma. These particles gain energy, on the average, every time they cross the schock front and bounce off approaching scattering centers. Calculations demonstrate that the distribution function transmitted by a plane shock is roughly a power law in momentum with slope similar to that inferred in galactic cosmic ray sources. The generation of the scattering Alfvén waves by the streaming cosmic rays is described and it is argued that the wave amplitude is probably non-linear within sufficiently strong astrophysical shocks. Hydromagnetic scattering can operate on the thermal particles as well, possibly establishing the shock structure. This suggests a model of strong collisionless shocks in which high energy particles are inevitably produced very efficiently. Observable consequences of this model, together with its limitations and some alternatives, are described. Cosmic ray origin and astrophysical shocks can no longer be considered separately.},

These objects, which are well-studied in radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths, constitute one of the most intriguing source classes in VHE astronomy. H.E.S.S., an array of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia, has recorded an extensive dataset of VHE gamma-ray observations covering the central region of the Milky Way, both from pointed observations as well as from the Galactic Plane Survey conducted in the inner region of the Galaxy. From radio observations, several hundred SNRs are known in the Milky Way, but until now only few of them have been identified as VHE gamma-ray emitters. Using the H.E.S.S. dataset and a large ensemble of radio SNRs localized in the inner region of the Galaxy, the standard framework that links the origin of cosmic rays to the gamma-ray visibility of SNRs can now be tested. Here we present the ensemble of investigated SNRs and discuss constraints on the parameter space used within a theoretical model of hadronic VHE gamma-ray production.},

The SUMSS is therefore similar in sensitivity and resolution to the northern NRAO VLA Sky Survey.

We assume that the fluid obeys the perfect gas law and has finite thermal diffusivity. The latter is chosen to be small enough so that vigorous convective states develop. The properties of these convective solutions are analyzed as the aspect ratio of the computational domain is varied and as the value of the mean field is increased. For the cases with zero net flux, we find that a well-defined converged state is obtained for large enough aspect ratios. In the converged state, the dynamo can be extremely efficient and can generate substantial toroidal flux. We identify solutions in which the toroidal field is mostly symmetric about the mid-plane and solutions in which it is mostly anti-symmetric. The symmetric solutions are found to be more efficient at transporting angular momentum and can give rise to a luminosity that is up to an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding value for the anti-symmetric states. In the cases with a finite net flux, the system appears to spend most of the time in the symmetric states.},

We compare the results with the corresponding cases in which fixed temperature boundary conditions are applied. The most notable result is that the formation of a fully convective state in which the density is nearly constant as a function of height and the heat is transported to the upper and lower boundaries by overturning motions is robust and persists even in cases with radiative boundary conditions. Interestingly, in the convective regime, although the diffusive transport is negligible, the mean stratification does not relax to an adiabatic state.},

We assume that the fluid obeys the perfect gas law and has finite (constant) thermal diffusivity. The calculations begin from an isothermal state spanning three scale heights above and below the mid-plane. After a long transient the layers settle to a stationary state in which thermal losses out of the boundaries are balanced by dissipative heating. We identify two regimes. The first is a conductive regime in which the heat is transported mostly by conduction and the density decreases with height. In the limit of large thermal diffusivity this regime resembles the more familiar isothermal case. The second is the convective regime, observed at smaller values of the thermal diffusivity, in which the layer becomes unstable to overturning motions, the heat is carried mostly by advection, and the density becomes nearly constant throughout the layer. In this latter constant-density regime we observe evidence for large-scale dynamo action leading to a substantial increase in transport efficiency relative to the conductive case.},

  Abstract                 = {CO line emission represents the most accessible and widely used tracer of the molecular interstellar medium. This renders the translation of observed CO intensity into total H2 gas mass critical to understand star formation and the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and beyond. We review the theoretical underpinning, techniques, and results of efforts to estimate this CO-to-H2 "conversion factor," Xco, in different environments. In the Milky Way disk, we recommend a conversion factor Xco = 2x10^{20} cm^-2/(K km/s)^-1 with +/-30% uncertainty. Studies of other "normal galaxies" return similar values in Milky Way-like disks, but with greater scatter and systematic uncertainty. Departures from this Galactic conversion factor are both observed and expected. Dust-based determinations, theoretical arguments, and scaling relations all suggest that Xco increases with decreasing metallicity, turning up sharply below metallicity ~1/3-1/2 solar in a manner consistent with model predictions that identify shielding as a key parameter. Based on spectral line modeling and dust observations, Xco appears to drop in the central, bright regions of some but not all galaxies, often coincident with regions of bright CO emission and high stellar surface density. This lower Xco is also present in the overwhelmingly molecular interstellar medium of starburst galaxies, where several lines of evidence point to a lower CO-to-H2 conversion factor. At high redshift, direct evidence regarding the conversion factor remains scarce; we review what is known based on dynamical modeling and other arguments.},

  Abstract                 = {We model the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant in the framework of the circumstellar medium (C SM) interaction picture. In this model, the slow red supergiant wind of the supernova (SN) progenitor was swept into a dense shell by a fast stellar wind in the subsequent blue supergiant stage of the progenitor star. The supernova blast wave propagated quickly (≤ 100 yr) through the tenuous wind-blown bubble located within this shell and then slowed down in the dense (nH ˜15 cm-3) CSM shell. The shell was impulsively accelerated during this interaction stage; during the subsequent interaction with SN ejecta, the shell has been further accelerated to ˜2000 km s-1, the currently observed expansion rate. The comparison of our X-ray emission calculations with the ASCA spectrum suggests that about 8 Msun of X- material is present in Cas A. Most of this mass is located in the CSM shell and in the outlying red supergiant wind. The X-ray continuum and the Fe Kα line are dominated by the shell emission, but prominent Kα complexes of Mg, Si, and S must be produced by SN ejecta with strongly enhanced abundances of these elements. Our hydrodynamical models indicate that about 2 Msun of ejecta have been shocked. An explosion of a stellar He core is consistent with these findings.},

We present the results of X-ray expansion measurements that illuminate the origin of the radio asymmetry. We confirm the mean expansion rate (2011-2015) of 0.58% yr-1, but large spatial variations are present. Using the nonparametric “Demons” method, we measure the velocity field throughout the entire SNR, finding that motions vary by a factor of 5, from 0\buildrel{\prime\prime}\over{.} 09 to 0\buildrel{\prime\prime}\over{.} 44 yr-1. The slowest shocks are at the outer boundary of the bright northern radio rim, with velocities v s as low as 3600 km s-1 (for an assumed distance of 8.5 kpc), much less than v s = 12,000-13,000 km s-1 along the X-ray-bright major axis. Such strong deceleration of the northern blast wave most likely arises from the collision of SN ejecta with a much denser than average ambient medium there. This asymmetric ambient medium naturally explains the radio asymmetry. In several locations, significant morphological changes and strongly nonradial motions are apparent. The spatially integrated X-ray flux continues to increase with time. Based on Chandra observations spanning 8.3 yr, we measure its increase at 1.3 % +/- 0.8 % yr-1. The SN ejecta are likely colliding with the asymmetric circumstellar medium ejected by the SN progenitor prior to its explosion.},

This new set of Sedov models also allows for a partial collisionless heating of electrons at the blast wave and for energy transfer from ions to electrons through Coulomb collisions. X-ray emission calculations are based on the updated Hamilton-Sarazin spectral model. The calculated X-ray spectra are successfully interpreted in terms of three distribution functions: the electron temperature and ionization timescale distributions, and the ionization timescale-averaged electron temperature distribution. The comparison of Sedov models with a frequently used single nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) timescale model reveals that this simple model is generally not an appropriate approximation to X-ray spectra of SNRs. We find instead that plane-parallel shocks provide a useful approximation to X-ray spectra of SNRs, particularly for young SNRs. Sedov X-ray models described here, together with simpler plane shock and single-ionization timescale models, have been implemented as standard models in the widely used XSPEC v11 spectral software package.},

  Abstract                 = {Of the 30 or so Galactic magnetars, about 8 are in supernova remnants (SNRs). One of the most extreme magnetars, 1E 1841-045, is at the center of the SNR Kes 73 (G27.4+0.0), whose age is uncertain. We measure its expansion using three Chandra observations over 15 years, obtaining a mean rate of 0.023 % +/- 0.002 % yr-1. For a distance of 8.5 kpc, we obtain a shell velocity of 1100 km s-1 and infer a blast wave speed of 1400 km s-1. For Sedov expansion into a uniform medium, this gives an age of 1800 years. Derived emission measures imply an ambient density of about 2 cm-3 and an upper limit on the swept-up mass of about 70 {M}⊙ , with lower limits of tens of {M}⊙ , confirming that Kes 73 is in an advanced evolutionary stage. Our spectral analysis shows no evidence for enhanced abundances as would be expected from a massive progenitor. Our derived total energy is 1.9× {10}51 erg, giving a very conservative lower limit to the magnetar’s initial period of about 3 ms, unless its energy was lost by non-electromagnetic means. We see no evidence of a wind-blown bubble as would be produced by a massive progenitor, or any evidence that the progenitor of Kes 73/1E 1841-045 was anything but a normal red supergiant producing a Type IIP supernova, though a short-lived stripped-envelope progenitor cannot be absolutely excluded. Kes 73's magnetar thus joins SGR 1900+14 as magnetars resulting from relatively low-mass progenitors.},

  Abstract                 = {We report measurements of the X-ray expansion of the youngest Galactic supernova remnant, G1.9+0.3, using Chandra observations in 2007, 2009, and 2011. The measured rates strongly deviate from uniform expansion, decreasing radially by about 60% along the X-ray bright SE-NW axis from 0.84% ± 0.06% yr-1 to 0.52% ± 0.03% yr-1. This corresponds to undecelerated ages of 120-190 yr, confirming the young age of G1.9+0.3 and implying a significant deceleration of the blast wave. The synchrotron-dominated X-ray emission brightens at a rate of 1.9% ± 0.4% yr-1. We identify bright outer and inner rims with the blast wave and reverse shock, respectively. Sharp density gradients in either the ejecta or ambient medium are required to produce the sudden deceleration of the reverse shock or the blast wave implied by the large spread in expansion ages. The blast wave could have been decelerated recently by an encounter with a modest density discontinuity in the ambient medium, such as may be found at a wind termination shock, requiring strong mass loss in the progenitor. Alternatively, the reverse shock might have encountered an order-of-magnitude density discontinuity within the ejecta, such as may be found in pulsating delayed-detonation Type Ia models. We demonstrate that the blast wave is much more decelerated than the reverse shock in these models for remnants at ages similar to G1.9+0.3. Similar effects may also be produced by dense shells possibly associated with high-velocity features in Type Ia spectra. Accounting for the asymmetry of G1.9+0.3 will require more realistic three-dimensional Type Ia models.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the discovery of thermal X-ray emission from the youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3, from a 237 ks Chandra observation. We detect strong Kα lines of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. In addition, we detect a 4.1 keV line with 99.971% confidence which we attribute to 44Sc, produced by electron capture from 44Ti. Combining the data with our earlier Chandra observation allows us to detect the line in two regions independently. For a remnant age of 100 yr, our measured total line strength indicates synthesis of (1-7) × 10-5 M sun of 44Ti, in the range predicted for both Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae (SNe), but somewhat smaller than the 2 × 10-4 M sun reported for Cas A. The line spectrum indicates supersolar abundances. The Fe emission has a width of about 28,000 km s-1, consistent with an age of ~100 yr and with the inferred mean shock velocity of 14,000 km s-1 deduced assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc. Most thermal emission comes from regions of lower X-ray but higher radio surface brightness. Deeper observations should allow more detailed spatial mapping of 44Sc, with significant implications for models of nucleosynthesis in Type Ia SNe.},

  Abstract                 = {G1.9+0.3 is the youngest known Galactic supernova remnant (SNR), with an estimated supernova (SN) explosion date of ~1900, and most likely located near the Galactic center. Only the outermost ejecta layers with free-expansion velocities gsim18,000 km s-1 have been shocked so far in this dynamically young, likely Type Ia SNR. A long (980 ks) Chandra observation in 2011 allowed spatially resolved spectroscopy of heavy-element ejecta. We denoised Chandra data with the spatio-spectral method of Krishnamurthy et al., and used a wavelet-based technique to spatially localize thermal emission produced by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs; Si and S) and iron. The spatial distribution of both IMEs and Fe is extremely asymmetric, with the strongest ejecta emission in the northern rim. Fe Kα emission is particularly prominent there, and fits with thermal models indicate strongly oversolar Fe abundances. In a localized, outlying region in the northern rim, IMEs are less abundant than Fe, indicating that undiluted Fe-group elements (including 56Ni) with velocities >18,000 km s-1 were ejected by this SN. However, in the inner west rim, we find Si- and S-rich ejecta without any traces of Fe, so high-velocity products of O-burning were also ejected. G1.9+0.3 appears similar to energetic Type Ia SNe such as SN 2010jn where iron-group elements at such high free-expansion velocities have been recently detected. The pronounced asymmetry in the ejecta distribution and abundance inhomogeneities are best explained by a strongly asymmetric SN explosion, similar to those produced in some recent three-dimensional delayed-detonation Type Ia models.},

  Abstract                 = {I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions, objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits, integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials, and making use of a recent general approximation for any static potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also included in the current release; currently, these consist of two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail. Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of documentation. The test suite covers 99.6% of the code. galpy is available at http://github.com/jobovy/galpy with extensive documentation available at http://galpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest.},

The pulsar has a transverse velocity of 236 ± 11 km s-1 at position angle 22 ± 2 deg east of north at a projected separation of 0.097 pc from Sgr A*. Given the unknown radial velocity, this transverse velocity measurement does not conclusively prove that the pulsar is bound to Sgr A* however, the probability of chance alignment is very small. We do show that the velocity and position are consistent with a bound orbit originating in the clockwise disk of massive stars orbiting Sgr A* and a natal velocity kick of <~ 500 km s-1. An origin among the isotropic stellar cluster is possible but less probable. If the pulsar remains radio-bright, multiyear astrometry of PSR J1745-2900 can detect its acceleration and determine the full three-dimensional orbit. We also demonstrate that PSR J1745-2900 exhibits the same angular broadening as Sgr A* over a wavelength range of 3.6 cm to 0.7 cm, further confirming that the two sources share the same interstellar scattering properties. Finally, we place the first limits on the presence of a wavelength-dependent shift in the position of Sgr A*, i.e., the core shift, one of the expected properties of optically thick jet emission. Our results for PSR J1745-2900 support the hypothesis that Galactic center pulsars will originate from the stellar disk and deepen the mystery regarding the small number of detected Galactic center pulsars.},

Our analysis shows that the thermal emission of 3C 400.2 can be well explained by a two-component non-equilibrium ionization model, of which one component is underionized, has a high temperature (kT ≈ 3.9 keV) and supersolar abundances, while the other component has a much lower temperature (kT ≈ 0.14 keV), solar abundances and shows signs of overionization. The temperature structure, abundance values and density contrast between the different model components suggest that the hot component comes from ejecta plasma, while the cooler component has an interstellar matter origin. This provides the first evidence of an overionized plasma found in the outer regions of a supernova remnant, whereas the ejecta component of the inner region is underionized. In addition, the non-equilibrium ionization plasma component associated with the ejecta is confined to the central, brighter parts of the remnant, whereas the cooler component is present mostly in the outer regions. Therefore, our data can most naturally be explained by an evolutionary scenario in which the outer parts of the remnant are cooling rapidly due to having swept-up high-density ambient medium, while the inner parts are very hot and cooling inefficiently due to low density of the plasma. This is also known as the relic X-ray scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a comprehensive view of the W51B H II region complex and the W51C supernova remnant (SNR) using new radio observations from the VLA, VLBA, MERLIN, JCMT, and CSO along with archival data from Spitzer, ROSAT, ASCA, and Chandra. Our VLA data include the first λ = 400 cm (74 MHz) continuum image of W51 at high resolution (88''). The 400 cm image shows non-thermal emission surrounding the G49.2-0.3 H II region, and a compact source of non-thermal emission (W51B_NT) coincident with the previously-identified OH (1720 MHz) maser spots, non-thermal 21 and 90 cm emission, and a hard X-ray source. W51B_NT falls within the region of high likelihood for the position of TeV γ-ray emission. Using the VLBA, three OH (1720 MHz) maser spots are detected in the vicinity of W51B_NT with sizes of 60-300 AU and Zeeman effect magnetic field strengths of 1.5-2.2 mG. The multiwavelength data demonstrate that the northern end of the W51B H II region complex has been partly enveloped by the advancing W51C SNR and this interaction explains the presence of W51B_NT and the OH masers. This interaction also appears in the thermal molecular gas which partially encircles W51B_NT and exhibits narrow pre-shock (Δv ~ 5 km s-1) and broad post-shock (Δv ~ 20 km s-1) velocity components. RADEX radiative transfer modeling of these two components yield physical conditions consistent with the passage of a non-dissociative C-type shock. Confirmation of the W51B/W51C interaction provides additional evidence in favor of this region being one of the best candidates for hadronic particle acceleration known thus far.},

A simple uniform-expansion model describes the data well, giving an expansion rate of 0.642% ± 0.049% yr-1 and a flux increase of 1.7% ± 1.0% yr-1. Without deceleration, the remnant age would then be 156 ± 11 yr, consistent with earlier results. Since deceleration must have occurred, this age is an upper limit; we estimate an age of about 110 yr or an explosion date of about 1900. The flux increase is comparable to reported increases at radio wavelengths. G1.9+0.3 is the only Galactic SNR increasing in flux, with implications for the physics of electron acceleration in shock waves.},

These data permit the spatial and kinematic separation of several spectral features observed along the line of sight to W51 and establish the presence of a massive (1.2 x 10^6 M_⊙), large (Deltal x Deltab = 83 x 114 pc) giant molecular cloud (GMC), defined as the W51 GMC and centered at (l, b, V)_c ~ (49.5d, -0.2d, 61 km s^-1). A second massive (1.9 x 10^5M_⊙), elongated (22 x 136 pc) molecular cloud is found at velocities of ~68 km s^-1 along the southern edge of the W51 GMC. Of the five radio continuum sources that classically define the W51 region, the brightest source at lambda6 cm (G49.5-0.4) is spatially and kinematically coincident with the W51 GMC and three (G48.9-0.3, G49.1-0.4, and G49.2-0.4) are associated with the 68 km s^-1 cloud. Published absorption-line spectra indicate that the fifth prominent continuum source (G49.4-0.3) is located behind the W51 molecular cloud. The W51 GMC is among the upper 1% of clouds in the Galactic disk by size and the upper 5%-10% by mass. While the W51 GMC is larger and more massive than any nearby molecular cloud, the average H_2 column density is not unusual given its size, and the mean H_2 volume density is comparable to that in nearby clouds. The W51 GMC is also similar to other clouds in that most of the molecular mass is contained in a diffuse envelope that is not currently forming massive stars. We speculate that much of the massive star formation activity in this region has resulted from a collision between the 68 km s^-1 cloud and the W51 GMC.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first results coming from the observation of Kepler's supernova remnant obtained with the EPIC instruments on board the XMM-Newton satellite. We focus on the images and radial profiles of the emission lines (Si K, Fe L, Fe K) and of the high energy continuum. Chiefly, the Fe L and Si K emission-line images are generally consistent with each other and the radial profiles show that the Si K emission extends to a larger radius than the Fe L emission (distinctly in the southern part of the remnant). Therefore, in contrast to Cas A, no inversion of the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta layers is observed in Kepler. Moreover, the Fe K emission peaks at a smaller radius than the Fe L emission, which implies that the temperature increases inwards in the ejecta. The 4-6 keV high energy continuum map shows the same distribution as the asymmetric emission-line images except in the southeast where there is a strong additional emission. A two color image of the 4-6 keV and 8-10 keV high energy continuum illustrates that the hardness variations of the continuum are weak all along the remnant except in a few knots. The asymmetry in the Fe K emission-line is not associated with any asymmetry in the Fe K equivalent width map. The Si K maps lead to the same conclusions. Hence, abundance variations do not cause the north-south brightness asymmetry. The strong emission in the north may be due to overdensities in the circumstellar medium. In the southeastern region of the remnant, the lines have a very low equivalent width and the X-ray emission is largely nonthermal.},

We investigate a hadronic scenario for the production of the γ-ray emission. Methods: Molecular 13CO (J = 1-0) taken from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) and neutral hydrogen (HI) data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) have been used in combination with new 1420 MHz radio continuum observations carried out with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Results: From the new observations and analysis of archival data we provided for the first time a reliable estimate for the distance to the SNR G15.4+0.1 and discovered molecular clouds located at the same distance. On the basis of HI absorption features, we estimate the distance to G15.4+0.1 in 4.8 ± 1.0 kpc. The 13CO observations clearly show a molecular cloud about 5' in size with two bright clumps, labeled A and B, clump A positionally associated with the location of HESS J1818-154 and clump B in coincidence with the brightest northern border of the radio SNR shell. The HI absorption and the 13CO emission study indicates a possible interaction between the molecular material and the remnant. We estimate the masses and densities of the molecular gas as (1.2 ± 0.5) × 103 M⊙ and (1.5 ± 0.4) × 103 cm-3 for clump A and (3.0 ± 0.7)× 103 M⊙ and (1.1 ± 0.3) × 103 cm-3 for clump B. Calculations show that the average density of the molecular clump A is sufficient to produce the detected γ-ray flux, thus favoring a hadronic origin for the high-energy emission.},

  Abstract                 = {A search for maser emission at the 1720-MHz transition of OH has been made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) towards more than 200 southern sites of 1665- and 6035-MHz OH masers. 28 of the 36 detected 1720-MHz masers precisely coincide with the targets (15 previously known; 13 new discoveries) and are thus almost certainly of the star formation region (SFR) variety. Our observations revealed highly variable intensities for some previously known 1720-MHz masers, in extreme cases now preventing their detection. We interpret six new masers serendipitously discovered offset from any target position as an SFR subclass. Two other masers were chance detections of a quite different maser class associated with supernova remnants. Several instances of prominent 1720-MHz OH absorption occur. The 1720-MHz masers mostly coincide, to arcsecond accuracy, with a stronger 1665-MHz OH maser counterpart; in a few instances, 1665-MHz counterparts are much weaker, and the six 1720-MHz masers discovered offset from any target position (with no detectable 1665-MHz emission) are the ultimate examples, qualifying them as a distinct SFR subclass. At the sensitivity of the current survey, we find that SFR 1720-MHz masers are approximately one-sixth as common as 1665-MHz masers. The 1720-MHz masers preferentially occur at the sites hosting 6035-MHz masers - explicable in the context of current maser pumping models if 1720-MHz and 6035-MHz masers trace regions where the OH column density is higher, and the kinetic temperature lower, than at sites displaying only 1665-MHz masers. For each 1720-MHz maser, spectra of the two circular polarizations at high-velocity resolution were taken with the Parkes telescope. Similar observations, to monitor several previously known northern 1720-MHz masers, augment the southern sample. The Parkes spectra commonly reveal Zeeman splitting in magnetic fields of a few milligauss, and the largest field is a `record-setting' 16 mG. Compared with fields derived from other OH transitions at the same site, the 1720-MHz values generally imply the same direction of field, but the field strength tends to be higher, by as much as a factor of 2. This may be understood if the 1720-MHz masers preferentially occur at locations compressed to higher density, with enhanced frozen-in magnetic field. Such higher fields support a pumping scheme requiring high densities for the 1720-MHz masers. Towards most of the 1720-MHz maser sites lies an associated 6668-MHz methanol maser, consistent with pumping expectations that the methanol masers are also favoured by high densities. We also explore some sites in more detail, with new results obtained in the radio continuum and recombination lines, and at other masing transitions - a new position for 328.809+0.633 at the 1612-MHz OH transition, for example, confirms a rare spatial near-coincidence with a 1720-MHz maser (although offset in velocity).},

  Abstract                 = {The variation of radio brightness across individual shell supernova remnants has been investigated; on the average, the brightness decreases with increasing distance from the galactic plane (z), with a scale height of 110 pc. Part of the brightness gradient results from a dependence of diameter (D) on the density of the interstellar medium, but much of the gradient represents a z-dependence intrinsic to the radio emission process. We conclude that the relation Σ ∝ D-3 exp (- |z|/175), describes the typical evolution of the mean brightness (Σ) of supernova remnants at different z. The applicability of this relation extends to the faintest observable remnants and entails considerable revision of the diameters, distances and ages for some remnants; in particular, a long-standing anomaly concerning the faint (but young) remnant of AD 1006 is now explained. Estimates of the galactic distribution of supernovae are also affected by the z-dependence of Σ; we derive corrected values of 200 pc for the scale height of supernovae producing shell remnants, and 80 years for the mean interval between such supernovae. (This rate does not include supernovae which produce Crab-like remnants or no radio remnants.) We suggest that the galactic magnetic field is responsible for the intrinsic Σ-z dependence; the scale height of the field locally is then inferred to be 260 pc - possibly the first experimentally determined estimate.},

The X-ray emission peak location of this PWN is found to be offset by 24 arcsec from the centre of the 1.4-GHz emission of this nebula. The X-ray nebula is elongated in the direction from the X-ray peak to the 1.4-GHz emission centre. This offset suggests that G16.73+0.08 is an evolved PWN interacting with the SNR reverse shock. We identify a point source, CXO J182058.16 - 142001.5, near the location of the X-ray peak. The spectrum of the X-ray nebula can be described by an absorbed power law of photon index 0.98^{+0.79}_{-0.71} and hydrogen column density N_H=4.99^{+2.75}_{-2.28}× 10^{22} cm-2. CXO J182058.16 - 142001.5 is likely a pulsar. We estimate its spin-down power to be about 2.6 × 1036 erg s-1. Assuming its age at 3000 and 10 000 yr, its dipole magnetic field strength at the polar surface is estimated to be about 4.2 × 1013 and 1.3 × 1013 G, respectively.},

We first compare our data with published observations obtained either from a Fabry-Perot interferometer or from a long-slit spectrograph. Using a spectral deconvolution technique similar to the one developed by Čadež et al., we identify and resolve multiple emission lines separated by large Doppler shifts and contained within the rapidly expanding filamentary structure of the Crab. This allows us to measure important line ratios, such as [N II]/Hα, [S II]/Hα, and [S II] λ6717 /[S II] λ6731 of individual filaments, providing a new insight on the SE-NW asymmetry in the Crab. From our analysis of the spatial distribution of the electronic density and of the respective shocked versus photoionized gas components, we deduce that the skin-less NW region must have evolved faster than the rest of the nebula. Assuming a very simple expansion model for the ejecta material, our data provide us with a complete tridimensional view of the Crab.},

In Paper I, we present a three-dimensional (3D) dust extinction map within the footprint of XSTPS-GAC, covering a sky area of over 6000 deg2 at a spatial angular resolution of 6 arcmin. In the current work, the map is combined with data from gas tracers, including H I data from the Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array H I survey and CO data from the Planck mission, to constrain the values of dust-to-gas ratio DGR = AV/N(H) and CO-to-H2 conversion factor XCO = N(H2)/WCO for the entire GAC footprint excluding the Galactic plane, as well as for selected star-forming regions (such as the Orion, Taurus and Perseus clouds) and a region of diffuse gas in the northern Galactic hemisphere. For the whole GAC footprint, we find DGR = (4.15 ± 0.01) × 10-22 mag cm2 and XCO = (1.72 ± 0.03) × 1020 cm- 2 (K km s- 1)- 1. We have also investigated the distribution of `CO-dark' gas (DG) within the footprint of GAC and found a linear correlation between the DG column density and the V-band extinction: N(DG) ˜eq 2.2 × 10^{21} (A_V - AcV) cm^{-2}. The mass fraction of DG is found to be fDG ˜ 0.55 towards the Galactic anticentre, which is respectively about 23 and 124 per cent of the atomic and CO-traced molecular gas in the same region. This result is consistent with the theoretical work of Papadopoulos et al. but much larger than that expected in the H2 cloud models by Wolfire et al.},

Since stars in the mass range of 8 to 25-30 M ⊙ will end their evolution in the red supergiant phase without launching a Wolf-Rayet wind, the main-sequence wind-blown bubbles are mainly responsible for the extent of molecular gas cavities, while the effect of the photoionization is comparatively small. This linear relation can thus be used to infer the masses of the massive star progenitors of supernova remnants (SNRs) that are discovered to evolve in molecular cavities, while few other means are available for inferring the properties of SNR progenitors. We have used this method to estimate the initial masses of the progenitors of eight SNRs: Kes 69, Kes 75, Kes 78, 3C 396, 3C 397, HC 40, Vela, and RX J1713-3946.},

We have used a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the accuracy of the isothermal estimate by comparing the derived NHI, ISO with the true H I column density NHI. The simulation was carried out for a wide range of sightlines, including gas in different temperature phases and random locations along the path. We find that the results are statistically insensitive to the assumed gas temperature distribution and the positions of different phases along the line of sight. The median value of the ratio of the true H I column density to the isothermal estimate, NHI/NHI, ISO, is within a factor of 2 of unity while the 68.2 per cent confidence intervals are within a factor of ≈3 of unity, out to high H I column densities, ≤5 × 1023 cm-2 per 1 km s-1 channel, and high total optical depths, ≤1000. The isothermal estimator thus provides a significantly better measure of the H I column density than other methods, within a factor of a few of the true value even at the highest columns, and should allow us to directly probe the existence of high H I column density gas in the Milky Way.},

The model may also explain the lack of strong Fe line emission in the X-ray spectrum. The solutions with s = 2 are applicable to Type II supernovae because the expanding supernova envelopes probably interact with regions of presupernova mass loss.

In combination with the known estimates for two supernovae, the results of measurements show that the oxygen densities on day 300 are distributed in a narrow range, (2.3 ± 1) × 109 cm-3. This result does not depend on the distance, extinction, and model assumptions. Analysis of the density distribution found leads to the conclusion that the SN IIP explosion energy increases with stellar mass.},

In the numerically simulated example (ejecta mass of 3 M_sun;, ambient hydrogen density of 0.1 cm-3), the radiative stage begins after less than one sound crossing time from the end of the free-expansion stage, and as a result the interior of the blast wave never completely settles to the Sedov-Taylor similarity solution. The authors also provide a simple physical model for the overall dynamics and present analytic approximations, good to a few percent in radius and velocity when compared with the numerical simulations.},

The survey has searched for pulsations in 118 unidentified pulsar-like sources, requiring about 10,000 years of CPU core time. In total, this survey has resulted in the discovery of 17 new gamma-ray pulsars, of which 13 are newly reported in this work, and an accompanying paper. These pulsars are all young, isolated pulsars with characteristic ages between 12 kyr and 2 Myr, and spin-down powers between 1034 and 4 × 1036 erg s-1. Two of these are the slowest spinning gamma-ray pulsars yet known. One pulsar experienced a very large glitch {{Δ }}f/f≈ 3.5× {10}-6 during the Fermi mission. In this, the first of two associated papers, we describe the search scheme used in this survey, and estimate the sensitivity of our search to pulsations in unidentified Fermi-LAT sources. One such estimate results in an upper limit of 57% for the fraction of pulsed emission from the gamma-ray source associated with the Cas A supernova remnant, constraining the pulsed gamma-ray photon flux that can be produced by the neutron star at its center. We also present the results of precise timing analyses for each of the newly detected pulsars.},

  Abstract                 = {We present arcsecond resolution observations from the VLA with full Stokes polarimetry of the ground-state satellite line of the hydroxyl molecule (OH) at 1720.53 MHz (2Π3/2, J = 3/2, F = 2 --> 1) toward three Galactic supernova remnants: W28, W44, and IC 443. The total number of individual OH (1720 MHz) ``spots'' we detect in each of these three remnants is 41, 25, and 6, respectively. The OH (1720 MHz) features appear to lie along the edge of radio continuum emission from the supernova remnants, but they are displaced behind the leading edge of the shock as traced by the synchrotron emission. The brightness temperatures of the OH (1720 MHz) emission features range from 2 × 104 to 108 K, convincingly demonstrating the maser nature of the OH (1720 MHz) features. We argue that the partially resolved angular diameters that we measure for the masers are neither intrinsic sizes nor scattering disks, but result from a blend of several unresolved maser features near the same velocity. Thus, our computed brightness temperatures are lower limits to the true values. The characteristic antisymmetric S profile, indicative of Zeeman splitting in the weak-field case, is identified in the Stokes V spectrum of several of the brighter maser spots. The derived line-of-sight magnetic fields are of order 0.2 mG and are remarkably constant in both direction and magnitude over regions several parsecs apart. These are the first measurements of postshock magnetic fields in supernova remnants and demonstrate the importance of magnetic pressure in these molecular shocks. The velocity dispersion of the maser features is typically less than a few km s-1, and, except in the special case of W28, the mean maser velocity is equal to the systemic velocity of the remnant. We suggest that the maximum amplification of the maser transition will occur when the acceleration produced by the shock is transverse to the line of sight. Additional support for this point comes from the location of the masers in IC 443, and from molecular observations that allow the shock geometry to be determined. All of our observations are consistent with a model in which the OH (1720 MHz) is collisionally excited by H2 molecules in the postshock gas heated by a nondissociative shock. Finally, we end with a discussion of the importance of supernova remnants with OH (1720 MHz) maser emission as promising candidates to conduct high-energy searches for the sites of cosmic-ray acceleration.},

  Abstract                 = {The nine-year H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS) yielded the most uniform observation scan of the inner Milky Way in the TeV gamma-ray band to date. The sky maps and source catalogue of the HGPS allow for a systematic study of the population of TeV pulsar wind nebulae found throughout the last decade. To investigate the nature and evolution of pulsar wind nebulae, for the first time we also present several upper limits for regions around pulsars without a detected TeV wind nebula. Our data exhibit a correlation of TeV surface brightness with pulsar spin-down power $\dot{E}$. This seems to be caused both by an increase of extension with decreasing $\dot{E}$, and hence with time, compatible with a power law $R_\mathrm{PWN}(\dot{E}) \sim \dot{E}^{-0.65 \pm 0.20}$, and by a mild decrease of TeV gamma-ray luminosity with decreasing $\dot{E}$, compatible with $L_{1-10\,\mathrm{TeV}} \sim \dot{E}^{0.59 \pm 0.21}$. We also find that the offsets of pulsars with respect to the wind nebula centres with ages around 10 kyr are frequently larger than can be plausibly explained by pulsar proper motion and could be due to an asymmetric environment. In the present data, it seems that a large pulsar offset is correlated with a high apparent TeV efficiency $L_{1-10\,\mathrm{TeV}}/\dot{E}$. In addition to 14 HGPS sources considered as firmly identified pulsar wind nebulae and 5 additional pulsar wind nebulae taken from literature, we find 10 HGPS sources that form likely TeV pulsar wind nebula candidates. Using a model that subsumes the present common understanding of the very high-energy radiative evolution of pulsar wind nebulae, we find that the trends and variations of the TeV observables and limits can be reproduced to a good level, drawing a consistent picture of present-day TeV data and theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Radio continuum observations at 151 MHz of the galactic H II region complex W51 were made with the Cambridge Low Frequency Synthesis Telescope. The data were used to estimate the electron temperature of G49.5 - 0.4 and G49.4 - 0.3, two of the main components of W51. The values of electron temperature derived from radio continuum observations (about 3500 K) are significantly lower than those obtained from recombination lines (about 6400 K), which indicates the existence of internal variations of electron temperature in these nebulae. The existence of electron temperature gradients in H II regions would have an important effect on the chemical abundance determinations. The nature of the shell-like component W51C, a possible supernova remnant, was also studied. AT 151 MHz, W51C appears very distinctly as a large incomplete shell obviously connected to W51B. This shell is an X-ray source, and no recombination line has been detected from it. A turnover in the spectrum of W51C was found by comparison of the present data with previous observations at higher frequencies.},

  Abstract                 = {Modeling the Local Bubble is one of those activities fraught with danger. It is very easy to be too naive, to fail to consider the dependence of the model on assumptions about the nearby ambient state, or the likelihood of such a structure. It is similarly easy to become so caught up in the details of the vicinity that it is unclear where to begin a necessarily idealized modeling effort. And finally, it is important to remember that the data we have may in some cases be lying to us, and that we have not yet learned to read their facial expressions quite carefully enough. That said, I've tried in this paper to be helpful to those who may wish to take the risks. I surveyed the very most basic stories that the data seem to tell, and pointed out the standard coincidences that may be telling us a lot about what is happening, but may turn out once again to have been just coincidences. I've described 5 distinct conceptions that in one flavor or another pretty well survey the collection of mental images that have so far been carried by those who've attempted models. One may be right, or something entirely different may be more appropriate. It's at least vital to realize that a conception comes first, followed by a simplified model of details. I've also included a long list of questions directed at observers. Some have partial answers, some one wouldn't know today quite how to approach. But it is a list that students of the soft x-ray background, interstellar absorption lines, possible instrumentation, and the heliosphere may wish to review from time to time, just to see whether they can figure out how to be more helpful. There is another list for modelers, things the models must address, however-so-flimsily if necessary, because there are strong observational constraints (and stronger ones coming) on what can and cannot be present in the local ISM. To that I've added a few remarks concerning x-ray emission coming from beyond the Local Bubble, and another few on how x-ray emission from within the solar system might be contaminating what we see. That last bit is new, exciting, and possibly wrong, but it is an example of the ongoing wariness I believe one has to take toward the facts in the case. By the way, Dieter, it really was a great meeting.},

The X-ray morphology places the remnant into the class of center-filled remnants with a centrally peaked X-ray emission profile and accompanying optical and radio shells. The emission is consistent with a thermal plasma with T = 3 × 106 K and absorption NH = 7 × 1021 cm-2. A ``breakout'' along the northeast rim of the remnant is coincident with the position of an X-ray pulsar. A much larger feature appears to be a partial shell which may be associated with a previous supernova remnant that swept the area around CTB 1 clean. The appearance of the remnant is most easily explained by evaporating clouds. Projection effects caused by an asymmetric remnant are discussed as another, less plausible, explanation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present numerical simulations of stellar wind dynamics in the central parsec of the Galactic Centre, studying in particular the accretion of gas on to Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole. Unlike our previous work, here we use state-of-the-art observational data on orbits and wind properties of individual wind-producing stars. Since wind velocities were revised upwards and non-zero eccentricities were considered, our new simulations show fewer clumps of cold gas and no conspicuous disc-like structure. The accretion rate is dominated by a few close `slow-wind stars' (vw <= 750kms-1), and is consistent with the Bondi estimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. This variability is due to the stochastic infall of cold clumps of gas, as in earlier simulations, and to the eccentric orbits of stars. The present models fail to explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years ago implied by Integral observations, but we argue that the accretion of a cold clump with a small impact parameter could have caused it. Finally, we show the possibility of constraining the total mass-loss rate of the `slow-wind stars' using near infrared observations of gas in the central few arcseconds.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a detailed discussion of our new 3D numerical models for the accretion of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In our most sophisticated models, we put stellar wind sources on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, we include recently discovered `slow' winds (vw~ 300kms-1), and we account for optically thin radiative cooling. We test our approach by first modelling only one-phase `fast' stellar winds (vw~ 1000kms-1). For stellar wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is of the order of , fluctuates by <~10 per cent, and is in good agreement with previous models. In contrast, decreases by an order of magnitude for wind sources following circular orbits, and fluctuates by ~50 per cent. Then we allow a fraction of stars to produce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively after being shocked, forming cold clumps and filaments immersed into the X-ray-emitting gas. We investigate two orbital configurations for the stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs with perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive to the orbital distribution of the stars. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, producing a quasi-steady `floor' in the accretion rate, of the order of ~3 × 10-6Msolaryr-1, consistent with the values deduced from Chandra observations. The cold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful accretion episodes, which may give rise to large-amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. The circularization radii for the flows are about 103 and 104 Schwarzschild radii, for the one- and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never forming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work. Our work suggests that, averaged over time-scales of hundreds to thousands of years, the radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher than it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion modelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the wind velocities, mass-loss rates and stellar orbits.},

  Abstract                 = {Rotation curves constrain a galaxy's underlying mass density profile, under the assumption that the observed rotation produces a centripetal force that exactly balances the inward force of gravity. However, most rotation curves are measured using emission lines from gas, which can experience additional forces due to pressure. In realistic galaxy disks, the gas pressure declines with radius, providing additional radial support to the disk. The measured tangential rotation speed will therefore tend to lag the true circular velocity of a test particle. The gas pressure is dominated by turbulence, and we evaluate its likely amplitude from recent estimates of the gas velocity dispersion and surface density. We show that where the amplitude of the rotation curve is comparable to the characteristic velocities of the interstellar turbulence, pressure support may lead to underestimates of the mass density of the underlying dark matter halo and the inner slope of its density profile. These effects may be significant for galaxies with rotation speeds lsim75 km s-1 but are unlikely to be significant in higher-mass galaxies. We find that pressure support can be sustained over long timescales, because any reduction in support due to the conversion of gas into stars is compensated for by an inward flow of gas. However, we point to many uncertainties in assessing the importance of pressure support in real or simulated galaxies. Thus, while pressure support may help to alleviate possible tensions between rotation curve observations and ΛCDM on kiloparsec scales, it should not be viewed as a definitive solution at this time.},

  Abstract                 = {New large-scale CO surveys of the first and second Galactic quadrants and the nearby molecular cloud complexes in Orion and Taurus, obtained with the CfA 1.2 m telescope, have been combined with 31 other surveys obtained over the past two decades with that instrument and a similar telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile, to produce a new composite CO survey of the entire Milky Way. The survey consists of 488,000 spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8deg) sample the entire Galactic plane over a strip 4deg-10deg wide in latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4deg sample nearly all large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al. (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10 times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. Each of the component surveys was integrated individually using clipping or moment masking to produce composite spatial and longitude-velocity maps of the Galaxy that display nearly all of the statistically significant emission in each survey but little noise. The composite maps provide detailed information on individual molecular clouds, suggest relationships between clouds and regions widely separated on the sky, and clearly display the main structural features of the molecular Galaxy. In addition, since the gas, dust, and Population I objects associated with molecular clouds contribute to the Galactic emission in every major wavelength band, the precise kinematic information provided by the present survey will form the foundation for many large-scale Galactic studies. A map of molecular column density predicted from complete and unbiased far-infrared and 21 cm surveys of the Galaxy was used both to determine the completeness of the present survey and to extrapolate it to the entire sky at |b|<32deg. The close agreement of the observed and predicted maps implies that only ~2% of the total CO emission at |b|<32deg lies outside our current sampling, mainly in the regions of Chamaeleon and the Gum Nebula. Taking into account this small amount of unobserved emission, the mean molecular column density decreases from ~3×1020 cm-2 at |b|=5deg to ~0.1×1020 cm-2 at |b|=30deg this drop is ~6 times steeper than would be expected from a plane-parallel layer, but is consistent with recent measurements of the mean molecular column density at higher latitudes. The ratio of the predicted molecular column density map to the observed CO intensity map provides a calibration of the CO-to-H2 mass conversion factor X≡NH2/WCO. Out of the Galactic plane (|b|>5deg), X shows little systematic variation with latitude from a mean value of (1.8+/-0.3)×1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s. Given the large sky area and large quantity of CO data analyzed, we conclude that this is the most reliable measurement to date of the mean X value in the solar neighborhood.},

Close to the upper mass limit of a white dwarf3 (1.4 solar masses), rapid accretion of hydrogen (about 10-7 solar masses per year) from a stellar companion leads to frequent eruptions on timescales of years4,5 to decades6. Such binary systems are known as recurrent novae. The ejecta of recurrent novae, initially moving at velocities of up to 10,000 kilometres per second7, must `sweep up' the surrounding interstellar medium, creating cavities in space around the nova binary. No remnant larger than one parsec across from any single classical or recurrent nova eruption is known8-10, but thousands of successive recurrent nova eruptions should be capable of generating shells hundreds of parsecs across. Here we report that the most frequently recurring nova, M31N 2008-12a in the Andromeda galaxy (Messier 31 or NGC 224), which erupts annually11, is indeed surrounded by such a super-remnant with a projected size of at least 134 by 90 parsecs. Larger than almost all known remnants of even supernova explosions12, the existence of this shell demonstrates that the nova M31N 2008-12a has erupted with high frequency for millions of years.},

  Abstract                 = {A new epoch of VLA measurements of Kepler's supernova remnant (SNR) was obtained to make accurate measurements of the radio spectral index variations and polarization. We have compared these new radio images with Hα, infrared (IR), and X-ray data to better understand the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of Kepler's SNR and to better understand the physical relationships between the various nonthermal and thermal plasmas. Spatial variations in the radio spectral index from -0.85 to -0.6 are observed between 6 and 20 cm. The mean spectral index is -0.71. The mean percent polarization is 3.5% at 20 cm and 6% at 6 cm. There is a strong correspondence between the radial and azimuthal profiles of the radio, X-ray, Hα, and IR emission in different locations around the remnant, although there is no single, global pattern. Spectral tomography shows that the flat- and steep-spectrum radio emissions have distinct structures. The flat-spectrum radio emission is found at either a larger radius than or coincident with the steep-spectrum emission. We interpret these spectral components as tracing forward- and reverse-shocked material, respectively. The flat-spectrum radio emission can alternatively be interpreted as the bow shocked material (reshocked by the forward shock) from the progenitor's motion through the interstellar medium. The Hα and IR images are very similar. Their leading edges are coincident and are either in front of or coincident with the leading edges of the X-ray and radio emission. The X-ray emission matches the Hα and IR emission in places and, in other places, traces the steep-spectrum radio emission. In the north, there is also an anticorrelation in the azimuthal profiles around the remnant of the flat-spectrum radio emission and the thermal X-ray, Hα, and IR emissions. We suggest that this could be due to a relative weakening of the particle acceleration at the forward shock due to Alfvén wave damping in regions of high density.},

  Abstract                 = {The binary pulsar J2222-0137 is an enigmatic system containing a partially recycled millisecond pulsar and a companion of unknown nature. While the low eccentricity of the system favors a white dwarf companion, an unusual double neutron star system is also a possibility, and optical observations will be able to distinguish between these possibilities. In order to allow the absolute luminosity (or upper limit) of the companion object to be properly calibrated, we undertook astrometric observations with the Very Long Baseline Array to constrain the system distance via a measurement of annual geometric parallax. With these observations, we measure the parallax of the PSR J2222-0137 system to be 3.742^{+0.013}_{-0.016} mas, yielding a distance of 267.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9} pc, and measure the transverse velocity to be 57.1^{+0.3}_{-0.2} km s-1. Fixing these parameters in the pulsar timing model made it possible to obtain a measurement of Shapiro delay and hence the system inclination, which shows that the system is nearly edge-on (sin i = 0.9985 ± 0.0005). Furthermore, we were able to detect the orbital motion of PSR J2222-0137 in our very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and measure the longitude of ascending node Ω. The VLBI astrometry yields the most accurate distance obtained for a radio pulsar to date, and is furthermore the most accurate parallax for any radio source obtained at "low" radio frequencies (below ~5 GHz, where the ionosphere dominates the error budget). Using the astrometric results, we show that the companion to PSR J2222-0137 will be easily detectable in deep optical observations if it is a white dwarf. Finally, we discuss the implications of this measurement for future ultra-high-precision astrometry, in particular in support of pulsar timing arrays.},

  Abstract                 = {It has often been suggested that supernova remnants (SNRs) can trigger star formation. To investigate the relationship between SNRs and star formation, we have examined the known sample of 45 SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to search for associated young stellar objects (YSOs) and molecular clouds. We find seven SNRs associated with both YSOs and molecular clouds, three SNRs associated with YSOs but not molecular clouds, and eight SNRs near molecular clouds but not associated with YSOs. Among the 10 SNRs associated with YSOs, the association between the YSOs and SNRs either can be rejected or cannot be convincingly established for eight cases. Only two SNRs have YSOs closely aligned along their rims; however, the time elapsed since the SNR began to interact with the YSOs' natal clouds is much shorter than the contraction timescales of the YSOs, and thus we do not see any evidence of SNR-triggered star formation in the LMC. The 15 SNRs that are near molecular clouds may trigger star formation in the future when the SNR shocks have slowed down to <45 km s-1. We discuss how SNRs can alter the physical properties and abundances of YSOs.},

This survey combines the high resolution of the Australia Telescope Compact Array with the full brightness temperature information of the Parkes single-dish telescope. In particular, we focus on the abundance and temperature of the cool atomic clouds in the inner Galaxy. The resulting mean opacity of the H I, <κ>, is measured as a function of Galactic radius; it increases going in from the solar circle, to a peak in the molecular ring of about 4 times its local value. This suggests that the cool phase is more abundant there, and colder, than it is locally. The distribution of cool-phase temperatures is derived in three different ways. The naive, ``spin temperature'' technique overestimates the cloud temperatures, as expected. Using two alternative approaches, we get good agreement on a histogram of the cloud temperatures, Tcool, corrected for blending with warm-phase gas. The median temperature is about 65 K, but there is a long tail reaching down to temperatures below 20 K. Clouds with temperatures below 40 K are common though not as common as warmer clouds (40-100 K). Using these results, we discuss two related quantities, the peak brightness temperature seen in emission surveys and the incidence of clouds seen in H I self-absorption. Both phenomena match what would be expected based on our measurements of <κ> and Tcool.},

  Abstract                 = {SuperNova Remnants (SNR) have been extensively studied in radio, X-rays and optical, but barely in the InfraRed (IR). From IRAS observations, SNR are known to be IR emitters, but the origin of the emission is difficult to assess because of the limited angular and spectral resolution of IRAS observations. ISO follow-up observations of the Cassiopeia-A SNR have shown that the mid-IR radiation from this remnant was dominated by thermal emission from silicate condensates made from SN material. These condensates constitute a probe which can provide unique information about element mixing inside a SN. In this paper, we present ISOCAM observations of the three other young SNR's known in our galaxy: the Kepler SNR, the Tycho SNR and the Crab Nebula. The emission observed from the Kepler SNR is dominated by dust thermal emission. The dust at the origin of the IR emission is circumstellar, not from SN condensates. ``Astronomical'' silicates, collisionally heated to a temperature of 107 K, can account for both the mid-IR ISO data and the IRAS data. The IR emission from Tycho is probably also emitted by circumstellar or interstellar dust. In order to reproduce both the mid-IR ISO data and the IRAS data, a model with two dust components, one at a temperature of 107 K and the other at 55 K, is needed. The mid-IR emission from the Crab is dominated by synchrotron radiation; no dust is detected.

  Abstract                 = {The explosion of a supernova releases almost instantaneously about 10^{51} ergs of mechanic energy, changing irreversibly the physical and chemical properties of large regions in the galaxies. The stellar ejecta, the nebula resulting from the powerful shock waves, and sometimes a compact stellar remnant, constitute a supernova remnant (SNR). They can radiate their energy across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, but the great majority are radio sources. Almost 70 years after the first detection of radio emission coming from an SNR, great progress has been achieved in the comprehension of their physical characteristics and evolution. We review the present knowledge of different aspects of radio remnants, focusing on sources of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, where the SNRs can be spatially resolved. We present a brief overview of theoretical background, analyze morphology and polarization properties, and review and critically discuss different methods applied to determine the radio spectrum and distances. The consequences of the interaction between the SNR shocks and the surrounding medium are examined, including the question of whether SNRs can trigger the formation of new stars. Cases of multispectral comparison are presented. A section is devoted to reviewing recent results of radio SNRs in the Magellanic Clouds, with particular emphasis on the radio properties of SN 1987A, an ideal laboratory to investigate dynamical evolution of an SNR in near real time. The review concludes with a summary of issues on radio SNRs that deserve further study, and analysis of the prospects for future research with the latest-generation radio telescopes.},

The current high quality observations enabled us to detect small-scale structures and weak diffuse emission in the interior of several remnants. We have recalculated fluxes, diameters and spectra, confirming previous estimates and improving them in some cases. At large scale the images were analized looking for traces of the influence of a non-uniform environment. In five out of the nine observed remnants, the brightest features occur on the side closer to the galactic plane. At fine scale, morphological properties were inspected together with spectral inhomogeneities in order to investigate whether the mechanisms that regulate the electron spectra can differ from the processes responsible for brightness enhancements. Our study shows that in general spectral variations coincide with brightness features, but the tendency of the relation is not uniform. Namely, G340.4+0.4 and G340.6+0.3 brighter regions have flatter spectra, while in G7.7-3.7, G15.9+0.2, and G341 .9-0.3 the highest emissivity features are the steepest, and in G18.8+0.3 no spectral variation was found, regardless of the brightness variations. Polarization observations were performed in G7.7-3.7, finding that polarization occurs preferentially on the half of the shell facing the galactic plane.},

Large electron abundances have been reported toward the position W51C-E located in this interaction region, and it was proposed that the enhanced ionization fraction was due to cosmic ray particles freshly accelerated by the SNR shock. We present Plateau de Bure Interferometer observations of the H13CO+(1-0) and DCO+(2-1) emission lines centered at position W51C-E. These observations confirm the previous scenario of cosmic-ray-induced ionization at this location. In addition, SiO(2-1) emission has been successfully mapped in the close vicinity of W51C-E, with a spatial resolution of 7''. The morphology and kinematics of the SiO emission are analyzed and strongly suggest that this emission is produced by the passage of the SNR primary shock. Put in conjunction with the enhanced ionization fraction in this region, we give a consistent picture in which the W51C-E position is located downstream of the shock, where a large reservoir of freshly accelerated particles is available.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of the dust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic history using data from the Science Demonstration Phase of the Herschel-Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (Herschel-ATLAS). The sample consists of galaxies selected at 250 ?m which have reliable counterparts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at z < 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. Dust masses are calculated using both a single-temperature grey-body model for the spectral energy distribution and also a model with multiple temperature components. The dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift. Splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in the dust properties of the most massive galaxies. At z= 0.4-0.5, massive galaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local Universe. At the same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about three to four times larger, and the optical depth derived from fitting the UV-sub-mm data with an energy balance model was also higher. This increase in the dust content of massive galaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolution models and requires a rapid gas consumption time-scale together with either a more top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction or combinations of all three. This evolution in dust mass is likely to be associated with a change in overall interstellar medium mass, and points to an enhanced supply of fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.},

  Abstract                 = {If Type II supernovae - the evolutionary end points of short-lived, massive stars - produce a significant quantity of dust (>0.1Msolar) then they can explain the rest-frame far-infrared emission seen in galaxies and quasars in the first Gyr of the Universe. Submillimetre (submm) observations of the Galactic supernova remnant, Cas A, provided the first observational evidence for the formation of significant quantities of dust in Type II supernovae. In this paper, we present new data which show that the submm emission from Cas A is polarized at a level significantly higher than that of its synchrotron emission. The orientation is consistent with that of the magnetic field in Cas A, implying that the polarized submm emission is associated with the remnant. No known mechanism would vary the synchrotron polarization in this way and so we attribute the excess polarized submm flux to cold dust within the remnant, providing fresh evidence that cosmic dust can form rapidly. This is supported by the presence of both polarized and unpolarized dust emission in the north of the remnant where there is no contamination from foreground molecular clouds. The inferred dust polarization fraction is unprecedented (fpol ~ 30 per cent) which, coupled with the brief time-scale available for grain alignment (<300yr), suggests that supernova dust differs from that seen in other Galactic sources (where fpol = 2-7 per cent) or that a highly efficient grain alignment process must operate in the environment of a supernova remnant.},

  Abstract                 = {Mass loss from massive stars (>~8 Msolar) can result in the formation of circumstellar wind-blown cavities surrounding the star, bordered by a thin, dense, cold shell. When the star explodes as a core-collapse supernova (SN), the resulting shock wave will interact with this modified medium around the star, rather than the interstellar medium. In this work we first explore the nature of the circumstellar medium around massive stars in various evolutionary stages. This is followed by a study of the evolution of SNe within these wind-blown bubbles. The evolution depends primarily on a single parameter Λ, the ratio of the mass of the dense shell to that of the ejected material. We investigate the evolution for different values of this parameter. We also plot approximate X-ray surface brightness plots from the simulations. For very small values Λ<<1 the effect of the shell is negligible, as one would expect. Values of Λ<~1 affect the SN evolution, but the SN ``forgets'' about the existence of the shell in about 10 doubling times or so. The remnant density profile changes, and consequently the X-ray emission from the remnant will also change. The initial X-ray luminosity of the remnant is quite low, but interaction of the shock wave with the dense circumstellar shell can increase the luminosity by 2-3 orders of magnitude. As the reflected shock begins to move inward, X-ray images will show the presence of a double-shelled structure. Larger values result in more SN energy being expended to the shell. The resulting reflected shock moves quickly back to the origin, and the ejecta are thermalized rapidly. The evolution of the remnant is speeded up, and the entire remnant may appear bright in X-rays. If Λ>>1, then a substantial amount of energy may be expended in the shell. In the extreme case the SN may go directly from the free expansion to the adiabatic stage, bypassing the Sedov stage. Our results show that in many cases the SNR spends a significant amount of time within the bubble. The low density within the bubble can delay the onset of the Sedov stage and may end up reducing the amount of time spent in the Sedov stage. The complicated density profile within the bubble makes it difficult to infer the mass-loss properties of the pre-SN star by studying the evolution of the resulting SNR.},

  Abstract                 = {The solution of the nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration problem, where the pressure of the nonthermal population is sufficient to modify the shock hydrodynamics, is widely recognized as a key to understanding particle acceleration in a variety of astrophysical environments. We have developed a Monte Carlo technique for self-consistently calculating the hydrodynamic structure of oblique, steady state shocks, together with the first-order Fermi acceleration process and associated nonthermal particle distributions. This is the first internally consistent treatment of modified shocks that includes cross-field diffusion of particles. Our method overcomes the injection problem faced by analytic descriptions of shock acceleration and the lack of adequate dynamic range and artificial suppression of cross-field diffusion faced by plasma simulations; it currently provides the most broad and versatile description of collisionless shocks undergoing efficient particle acceleration. We present solutions for plasma quantities and particle distributions upstream and downstream of shocks, illustrating the strong differences observed between nonlinear and test particle cases. It is found that, for strong scattering, there are only marginal differences in the injection efficiency and resultant spectra for two extreme scattering modes, namely large-angle scattering and pitch-angle diffusion, for a wide range of shock parameters, i.e., for nonperpendicular subluminal shocks with field obliquities less than or equal to 75° and de Hoffmann-Teller frame speeds much less than the speed of light.},

  Abstract                 = {The rate at which particles are accelerated by the first-order Fermi mechanism in shocks depends on the angle, ΘBn1 that the upstream magnetic field makes with the shock normal. The greater the obliquity, the greater the rate, and in quasi-perpendicular shocks (i.e., ΘBn1 → 90°), rates can be hundreds of times higher than those seen in parallel shocks. In many circumstances pertaining to evolving shocks (e.g., supernova blast waves and interplanetary traveling shocks) or where acceleration competes with losses (e.g., through synchrotron cooling), high acceleration rates imply high maximum particle energies, and obliquity effects may have important astrophysical consequences. However, as is demonstrated in this paper, the efficiency for injecting thermal particles into the acceleration mechanism also depends strongly on obliquity and, in general, varies inversely with ΘBn1; shocks which accelerate particles most rapidly are least capable of injecting thermal particles into the acceleration process. In addition, the degree of turbulence and the resulting cross-field diffusion strongly influences both injection efficiency and acceleration rates. The test particle Monte Carlo simulation of shock acceleration used here assumes large-angle scattering, computes particle orbits exactly in shocked, laminar, nonrelativistic flows (in contrast to our previous simulations of oblique shocks, which assumed magnetic moment conservation), and calculates the injection efficiency as a function of obliquity, Mach number, and degree of turbulence. We find that turbulence must be quite strong for high Mach number, highly oblique shocks to inject significant numbers of thermal particles and that only modest gains in acceleration rates can be expected for strong oblique shocks over parallel ones if the only source of seed particles is the thermal background.},

  Abstract                 = {3C 400.2 belongs to the mixed-morphology supernova remnant class, showing center-filled X-ray and shell-like radio morphology. We present a study of 3C 400.2 with archival Suzaku and Fermi-LAT observations. We find recombining plasma (RP) in the Suzaku spectra of north-east and south-east regions. The spectra of these regions are well described by two-component thermal plasma models: the hard component is in RP, while the soft component is in collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) conditions. The RP has enhanced abundances, indicating that the X-ray emission has an ejecta origin, while the CIE has solar abundances associated with the interstellar material. The X-ray spectra of north-west and south-west regions are best fitted by a two-component thermal plasma model: an ionizing and a CIE plasma.

  Abstract                 = {The nature of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies >1020eV remains a mystery. They are likely to be of extragalactic origin, but should be absorbed within ~50Mpc through interactions with the cosmic microwave background. As there are no sufficiently powerful accelerators within this distance from the Galaxy, explanations for UHECRs range from unusual astrophysical sources to exotic string physics. Also unclear is whether UHECRs consist of protons, heavy nuclei, neutrinos or γ-rays. To resolve these questions, larger detectors with higher duty cycles and which combine multiple detection techniques are needed. Radio emission from UHECRs, on the other hand, is unaffected by attenuation, has a high duty cycle, gives calorimetric measurements and provides high directional accuracy. Here we report the detection of radio flashes from cosmic-ray air showers using low-cost digital radio receivers. We show that the radiation can be understood in terms of the geosynchrotron effect. Our results show that it should be possible to determine the nature and composition of UHECRs with combined radio and particle detectors, and to detect the ultrahigh-energy neutrinos expected from flavour mixing.},

The detailed process of the formation of the peculiar profile of the shock is still unclear. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for the remnant to revisit its evolution. In the simulations, the progenitor ejects an anisotropic, latitude-dependent wind, and travels in a direction that is not aligned with the symmetry axis of the wind. As a result, a cavity with a fringed structure is produced. The remnant has evolved in the cavity for about 104 yr. In the north-east, the shock has first encountered the bow shock, and this part corresponds to the bright north-eastern region. The south blowout is formed due to the shock travelling into the undisturbed wind, and the interaction of the shock with the cavity leads to the other peculiar features of the shock structure. The resulting profile of the remnant is consistent with that indicated in X-rays. It can be concluded that the supernova explosion occurred in the cavity produced by an anisotropic stellar wind experiencing two main phases with different wind velocities.},

The simulation is initiated with the supernova ejecta imbedded in the turbulent environment, and the distributions of the density and the magnetic field within the shock wave can be obtained. Assuming that the number of the protons accelerated by the forward shock is proportional to the local density since more protons can be injected into the diffusive shock acceleration process with a higher density, the morphology of the emission produced via the inelastic collisions between the accelerated protons with the ambient matter is achieved. Furthermore, the X-ray map of the synchrotron radiation and the γ-ray image of the inverse Compton scattering can be obtained with the assumption that the relativistic electrons have a similar spatial distribution as the protons. The results show that the shock front is distorted by the turbulent medium, and the morphologies of the non-thermal emission from RX J0852.0-4622, which shows a broken shell with bright rims at the shock in the observed images both in the X-ray band and in the TeV γ-ray band, can be generally reproduced using the model.

The initial conditions assume that the expansion of the supernova ejecta is of free inertia with a power-law density distribution in the outer part of the ejecta. To include the effects of the diffusive shock acceleration process and the escape of the accelerated particles from the shock front, we use different adiabatic indices in the simulations to study the dynamical evolution of the Type Ia SNRs. Moreover, we investigate the interactions of a SNR with either a small or a large clump. A double-shock structure with a contact discontinuity is produced as the ejecta flow supersonically in the ambient medium; Rayleigh-Taylor instability is clearly shown as fingers near the contact discontinuity in the contour maps of density, and a high density and a high magnetic field can be triggered because of the instability around the Rayleigh-Taylor fingers. We perform simulations with different adiabatic indices, and the results show that a narrower intershock region is produced with a smaller adiabatic index because a larger compression ratio for the SNR shock is induced. The influence of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability on the morphologies of both the forward and reverse shocks is more significant with a smaller adiabatic index. Finally, the simulations of a SNR interacting with a dense clump show that the morphology of the remnant is greatly twisted after the collision, and a filament with a high density and a high magnetic field can be produced as a SNR colliding with a large dense clump.},

The shell emits intense radio synchrotron photons, and high-energy γ-rays from the remnant have been detected using the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), the High-Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope, and the Milagro gamma-ray observatory. Based on a semi-analytical approach to the non-linear shock acceleration process, we investigate the multiband non-thermal emission from W51C. The result shows that the radio emission from the remnant can be explained as synchrotron radiation of the electrons accelerated by part of the shock flowing into the ambient medium. However, the high-energy γ-rays detected by the Fermi LAT are mainly produced via proton-proton collisions of the high-energy protons with the ambient matter in the molecular cloud overtaken by the other part of the shock. We propose a possible explanation for the multiband non-thermal emission from W51C. It can be concluded that a molecular cloud overtaken by a shock wave can be an important emitter in GeV γ-rays.},

  Abstract                 = {Low-density graphite spherules from the Murchison carbonaceous chondrite contain TiC grains and possess excess 28Si and 44Ca (from decay of short-lived 44Ti). These and other isotopic anomalies indicate that such grains formed by condensation from mixtures of ejecta from the interior of a core-collapse supernova with those from the exterior. Using homogenized chemical and isotopic model compositions of the eight main burning zones as end-members, Travaglio et al. (1999) attempted to find mixtures whose isotopic compositions match those observed in the graphite spherules, subject to the condition that the atomic C/O ratio = 1. They were partially successful, but this chemical condition does not guarantee condensation of TiC at a higher temperature than graphite, which is indicated by the spherule textures. In the present work, model compositions of relatively thin layers of ejecta within the main burning zones computed by Rauscher et al. (2002) for Type II supernovae of 15, 21 and 25 M &#664; are used to construct mixtures whose chemical compositions cause equilibrium condensation of TiC at a higher temperature than graphite in an attempt to match the textures and isotopic compositions of the spherules simultaneously. The variation of pressure with temperature and the change in elemental abundances with time due to radioactive decay were taken into account in the condensation calculations. Layers were found within the main Ni, O/Ne, He/C and He/N zones that, when mixed together, simultaneously match the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions, 44Ti/ 48Ti ratios and inferred initial 26Al/ 27Al ratios of the low-density graphite spherules, even at subsolar 12C/ 13C ratios. Due to the relatively large proportion of material from the Ni zone and the relative amounts of the two layers of the Ni zone required to meet these conditions, predicted 28Si excesses are larger than observed in the low-density graphite spherules, and large negative δ46Ti/ 48Ti, δ47Ti/ 48Ti, δ49Ti/ 48Ti and δ50Ti/ 48Ti are produced, in contrast to the observed normal δ46Ti/ 48Ti and δ47Ti/ 48Ti, large positive δ49Ti/ 48Ti and smaller positive δ50Ti/ 48Ti. Although better matches to the observed δ46Ti/ 48Ti, δ47Ti/ 48Ti and 28Si excesses can be found using much smaller amounts of Ni zone material and some Si/S zone material, it is very difficult to match simultaneously the Ti and Si isotopic compositions in any mixtures of material from these deep layers with He/C and He/N zone material, regardless of the condensation sequence. The occurrence of Fe-rich, Si-poor metal grains inside the graphite spherules does not have a satisfactory explanation.},

  Abstract                 = {Supernova remnants are believed to be major contributors to Galactic cosmic rays. In this paper, we explore how the non-thermal emission from young remnants can be used to probe the production of energetic particles at the shock (both protons and electrons). Our model couples hydrodynamic simulations of a supernova remnant with a kinetic treatment of particle acceleration. We include two important back-reaction loops upstream of the shock: energetic particles can (1) modify the flow structure and (2) amplify the magnetic field. As the latter process is not fully understood, we use different limit cases that encompass a wide range of possibilities. We follow the history of the shock dynamics and of the particle transport downstream of the shock, which allows us to compute the non-thermal emission from the remnant at any given age. We do this in three dimensions, in order to generate projected maps that can be compared with observations. We observe that completely different recipes for the magnetic field can lead to similar modifications of the shock structure, although to very different configurations of the field and particles. We show how this affects the emission patterns in different energy bands, from radio to X-rays and γ-rays. High magnetic fields (>100 μG) directly impact the synchrotron emission from electrons, by restricting their emission to thin rims, and indirectly impact the inverse Compton emission from electrons and also the pion decay emission from protons, mostly by shifting their cut-off energies to respectively lower and higher energies.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims:In this work numerical simulations showing the time evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) in uniform and non-uniform interstellar medium (ISM) are presented. Methods: We use a hydrodynamic model including a kinematic calculation of the interstellar magnetic field. Important parameters influencing SNR evolution include the ejecta mass and energy of the remnant, as well as the ISM density and adiabatic index. Results: By varying these parameters we constructed an analytical expression giving the return time of the SNR reverse shock to the origin, in terms of these parameters. We also found that the reverse shock spends half of its time moving outward and the other half returning to the origin. Also computed is SNR evolution in non-uniform media where the blast wave moves from one medium into either a less or more dense medium. As the SNR moves into a medium of higher density a reflection wave is created at the interface between the two media which is driven back toward the center. This drives mass via a nonspherical flow away from the discontinuity. As this wave moves inward it also drags some of the ISM field lines (if the field is parallel with the interface) with it and heats the inside of the SNR resulting in larger temperatures in this region. When a SNR explodes in a medium with a high density and the blast wave propagates into a medium with a lower density, a cavity is being blown away changing the geometry of the high density region. Also, once the forward shock moves into the medium of less density a second reverse shock will start to evolve in this region.},

Methods: We review the observational knowledge that has built up over the past 25 years on interstellar magnetic fields within ~200 pc of the Galactic center. We then critically discuss the various theoretical interpretations and scenarios proposed to explain the existing observations. We also study the possible connections with the general Galactic magnetic field and describe the observational situation in external galaxies. Results: We propose a coherent picture of the magnetic field near the Galactic center, which reconciles some of the seemingly divergent views and which best accounts for the vast body of observations. Our main conclusions are the following. In the diffuse intercloud medium, the large-scale magnetic field is approximately poloidal and its value is generally close to equipartition with cosmic rays (~10 μG), except in localized filaments where the field strength can reach ~1 mG. In dense interstellar clouds, the magnetic field is approximately horizontal and its value is typically ~1 mG.},

We find a fragmented and thin-walled atomic hydrogen shell inside which the SNR is seen to be contained at v≃ -80 km s-1, which we report to be a highly evolved stellar wind bubble (SWB) associated with the remnant. A dark area in the midst of otherwise bright line emission is also seen near -71 km s-1. An absorption profile to the extragalactic continuum source 4C 51.45 (superimposed on the shell's north face) allows us to probe the shell's optical depth, kinetic temperature and expansion velocity. The material in the dark area has the same properties as material in the fragmented shell, suggesting that the dark area is actually the far-side ``cap'' of the shell seen absorbing emission from warm background gas, the first instance of H I Self Absorption (HISA) seen in such a structure. We show that the kinematic distance of 10 kpc derived from a flat Galactic rotation model is highly improbable, and that this bubble/SNR system is most likely resident in the Perseus Spiral Arm, lying 5.2 kpc distant. We model the SWB shell in three dimensions as a homologously expanding ellipsoid. Physical and dynamical characteristics of the bubble are determined, showing its advanced evolutionary state. Finally, from a photometric search for one or more stars associated with the SWB, we determine that three B0V stars and one O4V star currently inhabit this bubble, and that the progenitor of 3C 434.1 was at latest also an O4 type star.},

We argue that these features are masers and that they are physically associated with the supernova remnants. A model in which the masers are collisionally excited by the passage of the supernova remnant shock through a molecular cloud best describes the data. Thus, in addition to the stellar masers and the masers found in star forming regions, there is now a new and growing class of masers found in supernova remnants. The OH(1720 MHz) line provides a powerful new diagnostic for finding and studying the interaction of supernova remnants with molecular clouds.},

  Abstract                 = {We have made Very Large Array (VLA) images of the fields around three young pulsars which have resulted in the discovery of two new supernova remnants and confirmation of a third. We argue that, in at least two cases and perhaps the third, the pulsars are physically associated with these supernova remnants. A review of all known young pulsars shows that the majority are associated with supernova remnants. We show that the typical density of the interstellar medium into which the supernova remnants are evolving is 0.2/cu cm, instead of the low value of 0.01/cu cm which had been calculated from other studies, and results in a considerably longer radio lifetime for supernova remnants. Both the morphology of the supernova remnants and the location of the pulsars imply that most of these young pulsars are born with large transverse velocities (approximately 500 km/s). This high velocity mean in the distribution of pulsar velocities appears to be a general property of the pulsar population at birth, not seen in proper motion studies, due to selection effects. We explore the implications of this result as it relates to the origin of these velocities and the Galactic distribution of pulsars. High-velocity pulsars can escape their supernova remnant in a very short timescale, comparable to the lifetime of the remnant, and may even play a role in extending the observable radio lifetime of the remnant. A significant fraction will be capable of escaping the disk of the Galaxy, producing an extended halo population.},

The Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that are generated by the deceleration of a supernova remnant during the ejecta-dominated phase are known to produce finger-like structures in the matter distribution that modify the geometry of the remnant. The morphology of supernova remnants is also expected to be modified when efficient particle acceleration occurs at their shocks. Aims: The impact of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities from the ejecta-dominated to the Sedov-Taylor phase is investigated over one octant of the supernova remnant. We also study the effect of efficient particle acceleration at the forward shock on the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Methods: We modified the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code RAMSES to study with hydrodynamic numerical simulations the evolution of supernova remnants in the framework of an expanding reference frame. The adiabatic index of a relativistic gas between the forward shock and the contact discontinuity mimics the presence of accelerated particles. Results: The great advantage of the super-comoving coordinate system adopted here is that it minimizes numerical diffusion at the contact discontinuity, since it is stationary with respect to the grid. We propose an accurate expression for the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures that smoothly connects the early growth to the asymptotic self-similar behaviour. Conclusions: The development of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures is affected, although not drastically, if the blast wave is dominated by cosmic rays. The amount of ejecta that reaches the shocked interstellar medium is smaller in this case. If acceleration were to occur at both shocks, the extent of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures would be similar but the reverse shock would be strongly perturbed.},

This first paper deals with the evolution of the circumstellar gas around an isolated 60 Msolar star. The interaction of the photoionized H II region with the stellar wind bubble forms a variety of interesting structures like shells, clouds, fingers, and spokes. These results demonstrate that complex structures found in H II regions are not necessarily relics from the time before the gas became ionized but may result from dynamical processes during the course of the H II region evolution. We have also analyzed the transfer and deposit of the stellar wind and radiation energy into the circumstellar medium until the star explodes as a supernova. Although the total mechanical wind energy supplied by the star is negligible compared to the accumulated energy of the Lyman continuum photons, the kinetic energy imparted to the circumstellar gas over the star's lifetime is 4 times higher than for a comparable windless simulation. Furthermore, the thermal energy of warm photoionized gas is lower by some 55%. Our results document the necessity to consider both ionizing radiation and stellar winds for an appropriate description of the interaction of OB stars with their circumstellar environment.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we treat Fermi bubbles as a scaled-up version of supernova remnants (SNRs). The bubbles are created through activities of the super-massive black hole (SMBH) or starbursts at the Galactic center (GC). Cosmic-rays (CRs) are accelerated at the forward shocks of the bubbles like SNRs, which means that we cannot decide whether the bubbles were created by the SMBH or starbursts from the radiation from the CRs. We follow the evolution of CR distribution by solving a diffusion-advection equation, considering the reduction of the diffusion coefficient by CR streaming. In this model, gamma rays are created through hadronic interaction between CR protons and the gas in the Galactic halo. In the GeV band, we can well reproduce the observed flat distribution of gamma-ray surface brightness because some amount of gas is left behind the shock. The edge of the bubbles is fairly sharp owing to the high gas density behind the shock and the reduction of the diffusion coefficient there. The latter also contributes the hard gamma-ray spectrum of the bubbles. We find that the CR acceleration at the shock began when the bubbles were small, and the time scale of the energy injection at the GC was much smaller than the age of the bubbles. We predict that if CRs are accelerated to the TeV regime, the apparent bubble size should be larger in the TeV band, which could be used to discriminate our hadronic model from other leptonic models. We also present neutrino fluxes.},

  Abstract                 = {Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) that show thermonuclear bursts are ideal sources for constraining the equation of state of neutron star matter. The lack of independent distance measurements for most of these sources, however, prevent a systematic exploration of the masses and radii of the neutron stars, hence limiting the equation-of-state studies. We present here a measurement of the distance to the LMXB 4U 1608-52 that is based on the study of the interstellar extinction toward the source. We first model the individual absorption edges of the elements Ne and Mg in the high-resolution X-ray spectrum obtained with XMM-Newton. We then combine this information with a measurement of the run of reddening with distance using red clump stars and determine a minimum distance to the source of 3.9 kpc, with a most probable value of 5.8 kpc. Finally, we analyze time-resolved X-ray spectra of Type I X-ray bursts observed from this source to measure the mass and the radius of the neutron star. We find a mass of M = 1.74 ± 0.14 M sun and a radius of R = 9.3 ± 1.0 km, respectively. This mass and radius can be achieved by several multi-nucleon equations of state.},

Based on a comparison between X-ray and radio observations, we argue that the two main radio components of G320.4-01.2 are a single supernova remnant (SNR), which H I absorption indicates is at a distance of 5.2 +/- 1.4 kpc. A high-resolution correspondence between radio and X-rays argues that the pulsar is interacting with the SNR via an opposed pair of collimated outflows. The outflow itself is seen as an elongated X-ray feature surrounded by a highly polarized radio sheath, while the interaction with the SNR manifests itself as a ring of radio/X-ray knots within the optical nebula RCW 89. We reject the hypothesis that the pulsar outflow powers the entire RCW 89 region. SNR G320.4-01.2 and PSR B1509-58 agree in distance and in rotation measure, and appear to be interacting. We thus conclude that the two objects are associated and have an age of 1700 yr. We propose that the SNR resulted from a high-energy or low-mass supernova that occurred near the edge of an elongated cavity. Such a model can account for the bilateral appearance of the SNR, its large apparent age, the significant offset of the pulsar from the centre of the SNR and the faintness of the pulsar-powered nebula at radio wavelengths.},

The observed proper motions are typically 1 milliarcsec/yr, and it is thought that they represent the kinematic motions of maser cloudlets. The transverse motions of most features appear to be random and are interpreted as turbulent motions created when strong stellar wind interacts with density inhomogeneities in the surrounding molecular cloud. The transverse and the radial velocity dispersions are compared, and the distance of W51 is calculated to be 7 + or - 1.5 kpc. Data are also presented on maser spot sizes, and maser cloud physical sizes. A large spread in the brightness temperatures of the maser features is reported, and the line widths of individual maser features are correlated with the local velocity dispersion.},

  Abstract                 = {The Galactic Center is an excellent laboratory for studying phenomena and physical processes that may be occurring in many other galactic nuclei. The center of our Milky Way is by far the closest galactic nucleus, and observations with exquisite resolution and sensitivity cover 18 orders of magnitude in energy of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretical simulations have become increasingly more powerful in explaining these measurements. This review summarizes the recent progress in observational and theoretical work on the central parsec, with a strong emphasis on the current empirical evidence for a central massive black hole and on the processes in the surrounding dense nuclear star cluster. Current evidence is presented, from the analysis of the orbits of more than two dozen stars and from the measurements of the size and motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr A* , that this radio source must be a massive black hole of about 4.4×106M⊙ , beyond any reasonable doubt. What is known about the structure and evolution of the dense nuclear star cluster surrounding this black hole is reported, including the astounding fact that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently with a top-heavy stellar-mass function. A dense concentration of fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole are discussed, three of which have orbital peri-bothroi of less than one light day. This “S-star cluster” appears to consist mainly of young early-type stars, in contrast to the predicted properties of an equilibrium “stellar cusp” around a black hole. This constitutes a remarkable and presently not fully understood “paradox of youth.” What is known about the emission properties of the accreting gas onto Sgr A* is also summarized and how this emission is beginning to delineate the physical properties in the hot accretion zone around the event horizon.},

An important ingredient for such an analysis is the age of the object, which, typically, is obtained from the spin-down history. This age is highly uncertain if the object's magnetic field varies appreciably over time. Other age estimators, such as supernova remnant ages and kinematic ages, only apply to a handful of neutron stars. We conduct a population synthesis study of the nearby isolated thermal emitters and obtain their ages statistically from the observed luminosity function of these objects. We argue that a more sensitive blind scan of the Galactic disc with the upcoming space telescopes can help to constrain the ages to higher accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. The density structure of molecular clouds determines how they will evolve. Aims: We map the velocity-resolved density structure of the most vigorously star-forming molecular cloud in the Galactic disk, the W51 giant molecular cloud. Methods: We present new 2 cm and 6 cm maps of H2CO, radio recombination lines, and the radio continuum in the W51 star forming complex acquired with Arecibo and the Green Bank Telescope at ~ 50″ resolution. We use H2CO absorption to determine the relative line-of-sight positions of molecular and ionized gas. We measure gas densities using the H2CO densitometer, including continuous measurements of the dense gas mass fraction (DGMF) over the range 104cm-3<n(H2) < 106cm-3 - this is the first time a dense gas mass fraction has been measured over a range of densities with a single data set. Results: The DGMF in W51 A is high, f ≳ 70% above n> 104cm-3, while it is low, f< 20%, in W51 B. We did not detect any H2CO emission throughout the W51 GMC; all gas dense enough to emit under normal conditions is in front of bright continuum sources and therefore is seen in absorption instead. Conclusions: (1) The dense gas fraction in the W51 A and B clouds shows that W51 A will continue to form stars vigorously, while star formation has mostly ended in W51 B. The lack of dense, star-forming gas around W51 C indicates that collect-and-collapse is not acting or is inefficient in W51. (2) Ongoing high-mass star formation is correlated with n ≳ 1 × 105cm-3 gas. Gas with n> 104cm-3 is weakly correlated with low and moderate mass star formation, but does not strongly correlate with high-mass star formation. (3) The nondetection of H2CO emission implies that the emission detected in other galaxies, e.g. Arp 220, comes from high-density gas that is not directly affiliated with already-formed massive stars. Either the non-star-forming ISM of these galaxies is very dense, implying the star formation density threshold is higher, or H ii regions have their emission suppressed.

  Abstract                 = {Whether supernovae are major sources of dust in galaxies is a long-standing debate. We present infrared and submillimeter photometry and spectroscopy from the Herschel Space Observatory of the Crab Nebula between 51 and 670 μm as part of the Mass Loss from Evolved StarS program. We compare the emission detected with Herschel with multiwavelength data including millimeter, radio, mid-infrared, and archive optical images. We carefully remove the synchrotron component using the Herschel and Planck fluxes measured in the same epoch. The contribution from line emission is removed using Herschel spectroscopy combined with Infrared Space Observatory archive data. Several forbidden lines of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen are detected where multiple velocity components are resolved, deduced to be from the nitrogen-depleted, carbon-rich ejecta. No spectral lines are detected in the SPIRE wavebands; in the PACS bands, the line contribution is 5% and 10% at 70 and 100 μm and negligible at 160 μm. After subtracting the synchrotron and line emission, the remaining far-infrared continuum can be fit with two dust components. Assuming standard interstellar silicates, the mass of the cooler component is 0.24+0.32 - 0.08 M ⊙ for T = 28.1+5.5 - 3.2 K. Amorphous carbon grains require 0.11 ± 0.01 M ⊙ of dust with T = 33.8+2.3 - 1.8 K. A single temperature modified blackbody with 0.14 M ⊙ and 0.08 M ⊙ for silicate and carbon dust, respectively, provides an adequate fit to the far-infrared region of the spectral energy distribution but is a poor fit at 24-500 μm. The Crab Nebula has condensed most of the relevant refractory elements into dust, suggesting the formation of dust in core-collapse supernova ejecta is efficient. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

  Abstract                 = {For almost two decades the properties of `dwarf' galaxies have challenged the cold dark matter (CDM) model of galaxy formation. Most observed dwarf galaxies consist of a rotating stellar disk embedded in a massive dark-matter halo with a near-constant-density core. Models based on the dominance of CDM, however, invariably form galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar bulges and steep central dark-matter profiles, because low-angular-momentum baryons and dark matter sink to the centres of galaxies through accretion and repeated mergers. Processes that decrease the central density of CDM halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory with observations of present-day dwarfs. This failure is potentially catastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different dark-matter particle candidate. Here we report hydrodynamical simulations (in a framework assuming the presence of CDM and a cosmological constant) in which the inhomogeneous interstellar medium is resolved. Strong outflows from supernovae remove low-angular-momentum gas, which inhibits the formation of bulges and decreases the dark-matter density to less than half of what it would otherwise be within the central kiloparsec. The analogues of dwarf galaxies-bulgeless and with shallow central dark-matter profiles-arise naturally in these simulations.},

We detect OH (1720 MHz) emission toward 33 SNRs. Additional observations of five SNRs not previously surveyed at Parkes were made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), bringing the total number of SNRs surveyed to 80. Confirmation observations with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the ATCA have resulted in the detection of compact emission from four objects, three of which are SNRs, and one which is believed to be associated with an R ii region (located 12' from a remnant). We argue that the OH (1720 MHz) features are indeed masers and that they are physically associated with the remnants. The present survey brings the number of SNRs searched in our Galaxy for OH (1720 MHz) emission to 160. Of these there are a total of 17 with maser detections (10% of the sample studied). Considering the distribution of the detections as a whole, we show that they closely trace the molecular gas in the Galaxy. The available evidence supports a model in which the masers are collisionally excited by the passage of the supernova remnant shock through an adjacent molecular cloud. As such, the OH (1720 MHz) line provides a powerful new diagnostic tool for investigating the interaction of SNRs with molecular clouds, including, for example, the identification of promising candidates for high energy searches for sites of cosmic ray acceleration. We also note that many of our OH (1720 MHz) detections are drawn from the morphological class of supernova remnants producing center-brightened, thermal x rays. We suggest that the presence of dense molecular gas is required to form this distinctive morphology.},

  Abstract                 = {We present far-infrared (FIR) and submillimetre images of the Crab nebula, taken with the ISOPHOT instrument onboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and with the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The ISOPHOT observations were made in the bands centred at 60, 100 and 170 μm, with FWHM of equivalent area Gaussian beams of 44, 47 and 93 arcsec, respectively. The 850-μm SCUBA image was processed using a maximum-entropy method algorithm and has a Gaussian FWHM of 17 arcsec. The 60- and 100-μm images show clear excess of emission, above that expected from an extrapolation of the synchrotron spectrum of the Crab nebula from lower frequencies, as previously seen from IRAS observations. The superior angular resolution of the ISOPHOT images reveal that about half this excess is attributable to two peaks, separated by ~80 arcsec. We also present spectra taken using the Long-wavelength Spectrometer onboard ISO, which show that the FIR excess is not due to line emission. The lower-resolution 170-μm image does not show any excess emission, but is possibly fainter, particularly in the NW, than expected from an extrapolation of the lower-frequency synchrotron emission. These findings are consistent with a picture in which the FIR excess is due to emission from a small amount of warm dust (in the ranges 0.01-0.07 and 0.003-0.02Msolar for astronomical silicate and graphite, respectively) which radiates predominantly at 60 and 100 μm but not at 170 μm, and which is superimposed on a synchrotron spectrum that gradually steepens towards shorter wavelengths throughout the far and medium infrared spectral range. The dust geometry is consistent with a torus of diameter ~0.8 pc created by the (red supergiant) supernova progenitor prior to its explosion, superimposed upon a broadly distributed component which may be supernova condensates in the filaments. The dust-to-gas ratio in the filaments is comparable to the interstellar value. Therefore, even if the condensates seen at the present epoch could ultimately escape the remnant without being destroyed, the surrounding interstellar medium will not be significantly enriched in dust. Our upper limit of ~0.02Msolar on the total mass of carbon in the form of graphite is consistent with the inference from the gas-phase carbon abundances that there has been no significant enrichment of the filaments in carbon nucleosynthesis products from the progenitor. To study spectral index variations in the radio synchrotron emission we compared the 850-μm image with a 20-cm Very Large Array (VLA) image. These images are very similar, implying that there is little variation in spectral index across the face of the remnant between these wavelengths. As seen previously, there are some spectral variations near the centre of the remnant. However, given the good agreement between the integrated flux density at 850 μm and the extrapolated synchrotron spectrum, together with the different epochs of the 850-μm and 20-cm images, we do not see the need for the second radio synchrotron component from the remnant, which has previously been proposed.},

A comparison of the observations reveals that there are significant (>10 σ) differences in the emission from the nebula at a rate of ~2% yr-1. These differences are confined to rather large (>~25'' × 25''), well-defined regions. One region is coincident with the end of the southern polar outflow, while the others are coincident with the torus surrounding the pulsar. The various regions have different time histories, but they generally show a monotonic change in count rate, some increasing and others decreasing. A possible explanation for the observed behavior is that the radial bulk motion of the relativistic wind after shock passage has slowed by 10%-20% over the 6 years of observations.},

We assume that the ears are formed by jets, and argue that these properties are compatible with the expectation from the explosion jet feedback mechanism. Based on previous studies of ears in CCSNRs and the similarity of some ears to those found in planetary nebulae, we assume that the ears are inflated by jets that are launched during the explosion, or a short time after it. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we find that the extra kinetic energy of the ears is in the range of 1-10 per cent of the explosion energy. As not all of the kinetic energy of the jets ends in the ears, we estimate that the typical kinetic energy in the jets that inflated the ears, under our assumptions, is about 5-15 per cent of the explosion energy. This study supports a serious consideration of jet-driven core-collapse supernova mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {The brightest and most surprising feature in the first all-sky maps of energetic neutral atom (ENA) emissions (0.2-6 keV) produced by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) is an almost circular ribbon of a ~140° opening angle, centered at (l, b) = (33°, 55°), covering the part of the celestial sphere with the lowest column densities of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC). We propose a novel interpretation of the IBEX results based on the idea of ENA produced by charge exchange between the neutral H atoms at the nearby edge of the LIC and the hot protons of the Local Bubble (LB). These ENAs can reach the Sun's vicinity because of very low column density of the intervening LIC material. We show that a plane-parallel or slightly curved interface layer of contact between the LIC H atoms (n H = 0.2 cm-3, T = 6000-7000 K) and the LB protons (n p = 0.005 cm-3, T ~ 106 K), together with an indirect contribution coming from multiply scattered ENAs from the LB, may be able to explain both the shape of the ribbon and the observed intensities, provided that the edge is <(500-2000) AU away, the LIC proton density is (correspondingly) < (0.04-0.01) cm-3, and the LB contains ~1% of non-thermal protons over the IBEX energy range. If this model is correct, then IBEX, for the first time, has imaged in ENAs a celestial object beyond the confines of the heliosphere and can directly diagnose the plasma conditions in the LB.},

We report on X-ray observations made with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory probing the warm-hot phase of the CGM of our Milky Way at about 106 K. We detect O VII and O VIII absorption lines at z = 0 in extragalactic sight lines and measure accurate column densities using both Kα and Kβ lines of O VII. We then combine these measurements with the emission measure of the Galactic halo from literature to derive the density and the path length of the CGM. We show that the warm-hot phase of the CGM is massive, extending over a large region around the Milky Way, with a radius of over 100 kpc. The mass content of this phase is over 10 billion solar masses, many times more than that in cooler gas phases and comparable to the total baryonic mass in the disk of the Galaxy. The missing mass of the Galaxy appears to be in this warm-hot gas phase.},

The geometry of the detected structures suggests that Vela X-1 has encountered a wedge-like layer of enhanced density on its way and that the shocked material of the layer partially outlines a wake downstream of Vela X-1. To substantiate this suggestion, we carried out 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of interaction between Vela X-1 and the layer for three limiting cases. Namely, we run simulations in which (i) the stellar wind and the interstellar medium (ISM) were treated as pure hydrodynamic flows, (ii) a homogeneous magnetic field was added to the ISM, while the stellar wind was assumed to be unmagnetized, and (iii) the stellar wind was assumed to possess a helical magnetic field, while there was no magnetic field in the ISM. We found that although the first two simulations can provide a rough agreement with the observations, only the third one allowed us to reproduce not only the wake behind Vela X-1, but also the general geometry of the bow shock ahead of it.},

In this process, one of the binary components becomes gravitationally bound to the very massive star, while the second one is ejected, sometimes with a high speed. We performed three-body scattering experiments and found that early B-type stars (the progenitors of the majority of neutron stars) can be ejected with velocities of >~200-400kms-1 (typical of pulsars), while 3-4Msolar stars can attain velocities of >~300-400kms-1 (typical of the bound population of halo late B-type stars). We also found that the ejected stars can occasionally attain velocities exceeding the Milky Ways's escape velocity.},

  Abstract                 = {When a massive star in a binary system explodes as a supernova, its companion star may be polluted with heavy elements from the supernova ejecta. Such pollution has been detected in a handful of post-supernova binaries 1 , but none of them is associated with a supernova remnant. We report the discovery of a binary G star strongly polluted with calcium and other elements at the position of the candidate neutron star [GV2003] N within the young galactic supernova remnant RCW 86. Our discovery suggests that the progenitor of the supernova that produced RCW 86 could have been a moving star, which exploded near the edge of its wind bubble and lost most of its initial mass because of common-envelope evolution shortly before core collapse, and that the supernova explosion might belong to the class of calcium-rich supernovae — faint and fast transients 2,3 , the origin of which is strongly debated 4-6 .},

  Abstract                 = {Most runaway OB stars, like the majority of massive stars residing in their parent clusters, go through the red supergiant (RSG) phase during their lifetimes. Nonetheless, although many dozens of massive runaways were found to be associated with bow shocks, only two RSG bow-shock-producing stars, Betelgeuse and μ Cep, are known to date. In this paper, we report the discovery of an arc-like nebula around the late M-type star IRC -10414 using the SuperCOSMOS H-alpha Survey. Our spectroscopic follow-up of IRC -10414 with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) showed that it is a M7 supergiant, which supports previous claims on the RSG nature of this star based on observations of its maser emission. This was reinforced by our new radio- and (sub)millimetre-wavelength molecular line observations made with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment 12-m telescope and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope, respectively. The SALT spectrum of the nebula indicates that its emission is the result of shock excitation. This finding along with the arc-like shape of the nebula and an estimate of the space velocity of IRC -10414 (≈70 ± 20 km s-1) imply the bow shock interpretation for the nebula. Thus, IRC -10414 represents the third case of a bow-shock-producing RSG and the first one with a bow shock visible at optical wavelengths. We discuss the smooth appearance of the bow shocks around IRC -10414 and Betelgeuse and propose that one of the necessary conditions for stability of bow shocks generated by RSGs is the ionization of the stellar wind. Possible ionization sources of the wind of IRC -10414 are proposed and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Composite supernova remnants (SNRs) constitute a small subclass of the remnants of massive stellar explosions where non-thermal radiation is observed from both the expanding shell-like shock front and from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) located inside of the SNR. These systems represent a unique evolutionary phase of SNRs where observations in the radio, X-ray, and γ-ray regimes allow the study of the co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. In this article, we report results from observations of the shell-type SNR G 15.4+0.1 performed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and XMM-Newton. A compact TeV γ-ray source, HESS J1818-154, located in the center and contained within the shell of G 15.4+0.1 is detected by H.E.S.S. and featurs a spectrum best represented by a power-law model with a spectral index of -2.3 ± 0.3stat ± 0.2sys and an integral flux of F(> 0.42 TeV) = (0.9 ± 0.3stat ± 0.2sys) × 10-12 cm-2 s-1. Furthermore, a recent observation with XMM-Newton reveals extended X-ray emission strongly peaked in the center of G 15.4+0.1. The X-ray source shows indications of an energy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 keV and more extended emission that fills the entire region within the SNR at lower energies. Together, the X-ray and VHE γ-ray emission provide strong evidence of a PWN located inside the shell of G 15.4+0.1 and this SNR can therefore be classified as a composite based on these observations. The radio, X-ray, and γ-ray emission from the PWN is compatible with a one-zone leptonic model that requires a low average magnetic field inside the emission region. An unambiguous counterpart to the putative pulsar, which is thought to power the PWN, has been detected neither in radio nor in X-ray observations of G 15.4+0.1.},

For this purpose, recent results from direct and indirect measurements of cosmic rays in the energy range from 10 GeV up to 1 EeV are examined. The energy spectra of individual elements, as obtained by direct observations, are extrapolated to high energies using power laws and compared to all-particle spectra from air shower measurements. A cut-off for each element proportional to its charge /Z is assumed. The model describes the knee in the all-particle energy spectrum as a result of subsequent cut-offs for individual elements, starting with the proton component at 4.5 PeV, and the second change of the spectral index around 0.4 EeV as due to the end of stable elements (/Z=92). The mass composition, extrapolated from direct measurements to high energies, using the poly-gonato model, is compatible with results from air shower experiments measuring the electromagnetic, muonic, and hadronic components. But it disagrees with the mass composition derived from Xmax measurements using Čerenkov and fluorescence light detectors.},

  Abstract                 = {We identify two candidate magnetars in archival X-ray observations of HESS-detected shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs). X-ray point sources in CTB 37B coincident with HESS J1713 - 381 and in G353.6 - 0.7 coincident with HESS J1731 - 347 both have anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP) like spectra, much softer than those of ordinary, rotation-powered pulsars, and no optical/IR counterparts. The spectrum of CXOU J171405.7 - 381031 in CTB 37B has a hard excess above 6 keV, which may be similar to such components seen in some AXPs. A new Chandra observation of this object reveals a highly significant pulsed signal at P = 3.82 s with pulsed fraction fp = 0.31. Analysis of an XMM-Newton observation of the second candidate, XMMU J173203.3 - 344518 in G353.6 - 0.7, yields only marginal evidence for a 1 s period. If it is not a magnetar, then it could be a weakly magnetized central compact object. Considering that these HESS sources previously attributed to the SNR shells are possibly centrally peaked, we hypothesize that their pulsars may contribute to diffuse TeV emission. These identifications potentially double the number of magnetar/SNR associations in the Galaxy and can be used to investigate the energetics and asymmetries of the supernovae that give rise to magnetars.},

We report on the determination of 223 rotation measures from polarization observations of relatively distant southern pulsars made using the Parkes radio telescope. Combined with previously published observations, these data give clear evidence for large-scale counterclockwise fields (viewed from the north Galactic pole) in the spiral arms interior to the Sun and weaker evidence for a counterclockwise field in the Perseus arm. However, in interarm regions, including the solar neighborhood, we present evidence that suggests that large-scale fields are clockwise. We propose that the large-scale Galactic magnetic field has a bisymmetric structure with reversals on the boundaries of the spiral arms. Streaming motions associated with spiral density waves can directly generate such a structure from an initial, inwardly directed radial field. Large-scale fields increase toward the Galactic center, with a mean value of about 2 μG in the solar neighborhood and 4 μG at a galactocentric radius of 3 kpc.},

The soft X-ray emission from W 51 C is well-represented by an optically thin thermal plasma in a non-equilibrium ionization state with a temperature of ˜0.7 keV. The elemental abundance of Mg is significantly higher than the solar value. We find no significant feature of an over-ionized plasma in W 51 C. The hard X-ray emission is spatially coincident with the molecular clouds associated with W 51 B, overlapping with W 51 C. The spectrum is represented by an optically thin thermal plasma with a temperature of ˜5 keV, or a powerlaw model with a photon index of ˜2.2. The emission probably has a diffuse nature, since its luminosity of 1 × 1034 erg s-1 in the 0.5-10 keV band cannot be explained by any emission from point sources in this region. We discuss the possibility that the hard X-ray emission comes from stellar winds of OB stars in W 51 B, or accelerated particles in W 51 C.},

In contrast to this expectation, the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) proton flux at 2.5 GV measured by Ulysses in 2008 does not exceed the one observed in the 1990s significantly, while the 2.5 GV GCR electron intensity exceeds the one measured during the 1990s by 30%-40%. At true solar minimum conditions, however, the intensities of both electrons and protons are expected to be the same. In contrast to the 1987 solar minimum, the tilt angle of the solar magnetic field has remained at about 30° in 2008. In order to compare the Ulysses measurements during the 2000 solar magnetic epoch with those obtained 20 years ago, the former have been corrected for the spacecraft trajectory using latitudinal gradients of 0.25% deg-1 and 0.19% deg-1 for protons and electrons, respectively, and a radial gradient of 3% AU-1. In 2008 and 1987, solar activity, as indicated by the sunspot number, was low. Thus, our observations confirm the prediction of modulation models that current sheet and gradient drifts prevent the GCR flux to rise to typical solar minimum values. In addition, measurements of electrons and protons allow us to predict that the 2.5 GV GCR proton intensity will increase by a factor of 1.3 if the tilt angle reaches values below 10°.},

This composite radio remnant has a core radio flux density of only 100 mJy, making it one of the faintest radio synchrotron nebulae yet detected, although the core-to-shell flux ratio at 6 cm is typical of the growing class of composite remnants. Our image is seriously contaminated by bright arcs produced by singly reflected X-rays from the X-ray binary GX 17+2, which lies just outside the field of view, providing an interesting data analysis challenge. Nonetheless, the remnant's synchrotron core is clearly detected. We report on the spectrum and intensity of the core emission as well as on our search for emission from the thermal shell and describe the constraints these observations provide on the remnant's distance, age, and central pulsar properties.},

The source detection threshold at 20 cm is in the range 1-2 mJy over the 85% of the survey region (5deg<l<32deg, |b|<0.8d) not covered by bright extended emission; the angular resolution is ~6". We catalog over 3000 discrete sources (diameters mostly <30") and present an atlas of ~400 diffuse emission regions. New and archival data at 90 cm for the whole survey area are also presented. Comparison of our catalogs and images with the Midcourse Space Experiment mid-infrared data allows us to provide preliminary discrimination between thermal and nonthermal sources. We identify 49 high-probability supernova remnant candidates, increasing by a factor of 7 the number of known remnants with diameters smaller than 5' in the survey region; several are pulsar wind nebula candidates and/or very small diameter remnants (D<45''). We report the tentative identification of several hundred H II regions based on a comparison with the mid-IR data; they range in size from unresolved ultracompact sources to large complexes of diffuse emission on scales of half a degree. In several of the latter regions, cospatial nonthermal emission illustrates the interplay between stellar death and birth. We comment briefly on plans for follow-up observations and our extension of the survey; when complemented by data from ongoing X-ray and mid-IR observations, we expect MAGPIS to provide an important contribution to our understanding of the birth and death of massive stars in the Milky Way.},

  Abstract                 = {Galactic cosmic rays reach energies of at least a few petaelectronvolts (of the order of 1015 electronvolts). This implies that our Galaxy contains petaelectronvolt accelerators (‘PeVatrons’), but all proposed models of Galactic cosmic-ray accelerators encounter difficulties at exactly these energies. Dozens of Galactic accelerators capable of accelerating particles to energies of tens of teraelectronvolts (of the order of 1013 electronvolts) were inferred from recent γ-ray observations. However, none of the currently known accelerators—not even the handful of shell-type supernova remnants commonly believed to supply most Galactic cosmic rays—has shown the characteristic tracers of petaelectronvolt particles, namely, power-law spectra of γ-rays extending without a cut-off or a spectral break to tens of teraelectronvolts. Here we report deep γ-ray observations with arcminute angular resolution of the region surrounding the Galactic Centre, which show the expected tracer of the presence of petaelectronvolt protons within the central 10 parsecs of the Galaxy. We propose that the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is linked to this PeVatron. Sagittarius A* went through active phases in the past, as demonstrated by X-ray outburstsand an outflow from the Galactic Centre. Although its current rate of particle acceleration is not sufficient to provide a substantial contribution to Galactic cosmic rays, Sagittarius A* could have plausibly been more active over the last 106-107 years, and therefore should be considered as a viable alternative to supernova remnants as a source of petaelectronvolt Galactic cosmic rays.},

This species of maser is well established as an excellent tracer of an ongoing interaction between the SNR and dense molecular material. For the majority of these objects we detect significantly higher flux densities with a single dish than have been reported with interferometric observations. We infer that spatially extended, low-level maser emission is a common phenomenon that traces the large-scale interaction in maser-emitting SNRs. In addition, we use a collisional pumping model to fit the physical conditions under which OH is excited behind the SNR shock front. We find the observed OH gas associated with the SNR interaction having columns NOH <= 1.5 × 1017 cm-2, temperatures of 20-125 K, and densities ~105 cm-3.},

The similarity of turbulent structure functions emphasizes the universality of turbulence in the molecular interstellar medium and accounts for the cloud-to-cloud size/line width relationship initially identified by Larson. The degree of turbulence universality is quantified by Monte Carlo simulations that reproduce the mean squared velocity residuals of the observed cloud-to-cloud relationship. Upper limits to the variation of the scaling amplitudes and exponents for molecular clouds are ~10%-20%. The measured invariance of turbulence for molecular clouds with vastly different sizes, environments, and star formation activity suggests a common formation mechanism such as converging turbulent flows within the diffuse interstellar medium and a limited contribution of energy from sources within the cloud with respect to large-scale driving mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {The rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way out to ˜100 kpc has been constructed using ˜16 000 primary red clump giants (PRCGs) in the outer disc selected from the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anti-centre (LSS-GAC) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III/APOGEE survey, combined with ˜5700 halo K giants (HKGs) selected from the SDSS/SEGUE survey. To derive the RC, the PRCG sample of the warm disc population and the HKG sample of halo stellar population are, respectively, analysed using a kinematical model allowing for the asymmetric drift corrections and re-analysed using the spherical Jeans equation along with measurements of the anisotropic parameter β currently available. The typical uncertainties of RC derived from the PRCG and HKG samples are, respectively, 5-7 km s-1 and several tens km s-1. We determine a circular velocity at the solar position, Vc(R0) = 240 ± 6 km s-1 and an azimuthal peculiar speed of the Sun, V⊙ = 12.1 ± 7.6 km s-1, both in good agreement with the previous determinations. The newly constructed RC has a generally flat value of 240 km s-1 within a Galactocentric distance r of 25 kpc and then decreases steadily to 150 km s-1 at r ˜ 100 kpc. On top of this overall trend, the RC exhibits two prominent localized dips, one at r ˜ 11 kpc and another at r ˜ 19 kpc. From the newly constructed RC, combined with other constraints, we have built a parametrized mass model for the Galaxy, yielding a virial mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo of 0.90^{+0.07}_{-0.08} × 10^{12} M⊙ and a local dark matter density, ρ_{⊙}, dm = 0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.02} GeV cm-3.},

Various experimental configurations have been employed to study aspects such as the energy scaling, geomagnetic dependence, lateral distribution, and polarization of the radio emission from cosmic rays. The high quality per-event air shower information provided by KASCADE-Grande has been the key to many of these studies and has even allowed us to perform detailed per-event comparisons with simulations of the radio emission. In this article, we give an overview of results obtained by LOPES, and present the status and perspectives of the ever-evolving experiment.},

This would enable a wealth of scientific applications: the physics of the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays could be probed with very high precision mass measurements, hadronic interactions could be studied up to energies well beyond the reach of man-made particle accelerators, air shower tomography could be performed with very high spatial resolution exploiting the large instantaneous bandwidth and very uniform instantaneous $u$-$v$ coverage of SKA1-LOW, and the physics of thunderstorms and possible connections between cosmic rays and lightning initiation could be studied in unprecedented levels of detail. In this article, we describe the potential of the SKA as an air shower radio detector from the perspective of existing radio detection efforts and discuss the associated technical requirements.},

In conjunction with data from the literature at lower radio frequencies, we determine spectra of these objects. For well-studied SNRs (Cas A, Tycho's SNR, 3C58 and the Crab Nebula), the results are in good agreement with spectra based on previous results. For the less well-studied remnants, the AMI SA observations provide higher-frequency radio observations than previously available, and better constrain their radio spectra. The AMI SA results confirm a spectral turnover at ~=11GHz for the filled-centre remnant G74.9+1.2. We also see a possible steepening of the spectrum of the filled-centre remnant G54.1+0.3 within the AMI SA frequency band compared with lower frequencies. We confirm that G84.9+0.5, which had previously been identified as a SNR, is rather an HII region and has a flat radio spectrum.

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested by radio observations of polarized synchrotron emissions that downstream magnetic fields in some young supernova remnants (SNRs) are oriented radially. We study the magnetic field distribution of turbulent SNRs driven by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI)—in other words, the effect of rippled shock—by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We find that the induced turbulence has radially biased anisotropic velocity dispersion that leads to a selective amplification of the radial component of the magnetic field. The RMI is induced by the interaction between the shock and upstream density fluctuations. Future high-resolution polarization observations can distinguish the following candidates responsible for the upstream density fluctuations: (1) inhomogeneity caused by the cascade of large-scale turbulence in the interstellar medium, the so-called big power-law in the sky; (2) structures generated by the Drury instability in the cosmic-ray modified shock; and (3) fluctuations induced by the nonlinear feedback of the cosmic-ray streaming instability.},

We discovered the spin period of SGR J1935+2154 through the detection of coherent pulsations at a period of about 3.24 s. The magnetar is slowing down at a rate of dot{P} = 1.43(1)× 10^{-11} s s-1 and with a decreasing trend due to a negative ddot{P} of -3.5(7) × 10-19 s s-2. This implies a surface dipolar magnetic field strength of ˜2.2 × 1014 G, a characteristic age of about 3.6 kyr and a spin-down luminosity Lsd ˜1.7 × 1034 erg s-1. The source spectrum is well modelled by a blackbody with temperature of about 500 eV plus a power-law component with photon index of about 2. The source showed a moderate long-term variability, with a flux decay of about 25 per cent during the first four months since its discovery, and a re-brightening of the same amount during the second four months. The X-ray data were also used to study the source environment. In particular, we discovered a diffuse emission extending on spatial scales from about 1 arcsec up to at least 1 arcmin around SGR J1935+2154 both in Chandra and XMM-Newton data. This component is constant in flux (at least within uncertainties) and its spectrum is well modelled by a power-law spectrum steeper than that of the pulsar. Though a scattering halo origin seems to be more probable we cannot exclude that part, or all, of the diffuse emission is due to a pulsar wind nebula.},

Using both position-switching and On-The-Fly mapping modes, we achieved an angular sampling of 22", better than half of the telescope's 46" angular resolution. The survey's velocity coverage is -5 to 135 km s-1 for Galactic longitudes l<=40deg and -5 to 85 km s-1 for Galactic longitudes l>40deg. At the velocity resolution of 0.21 km s-1, the typical rms sensitivity is σ(T*A)~0.13 K. The survey comprises a total of 1,993,522 spectra. We show integrated intensity images (zeroth moment maps), channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and an average spectrum of the completed survey data set. We also discuss the telescope and instrumental parameters, the observing modes, the data reduction processes, and the emission and noise characteristics of the data set.

  Abstract                 = {The first search for ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrinos using a radio telescope was conducted by Hankins, Ekers & O'Sullivan. This was a search for nanosecond duration radio Cherenkov pulses from UHE neutrino interactions in the lunar regolith, and was made using a broad-bandwidth receiver fitted to the Parkes radio telescope, Australia. At the time, no simulations were available to calculate the experimental sensitivity and hence convert the null result into a neutrino flux limit. Proposed future experiments include the use of broad-bandwidth receivers, making the sensitivity achieved by the Parkes experiment highly relevant to the future prospects of this field. We have therefore calculated the effective aperture for the Parkes experiment and found that when pointing at the lunar limb, the effective aperture at all neutrino energies was superior to single-antenna, narrow-bandwidth experiments, and that the detection threshold was comparable to that of the double-antenna experiment at Goldstone. However, because only a small fraction of the observing time was spent pointing at the limb, the Parkes experiment places only comparatively weak limits on the UHE neutrino flux. Future efforts should use multiple telescopes and broad-bandwidth receivers.},

  abstract      = {Turbulent dynamo field amplification has often been invoked to explain the strong field strengths in thin rims in supernova shocks ( ˜ 100 μG) and in radio relics in galaxy clusters ( ˜ μG). We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between pre-shock turbulence, clumping and shocks, to quantify the conditions under which turbulent dynamo amplification can be significant. We demonstrate numerically converged field amplification which scales with Alfvén Mach number, B/B_0 ∝ M_A, up to M_A ˜ 150. This implies that the post-shock field strength is relatively independent of the seed field. Amplification is dominated by compression at low M_A, and stretching (turbulent amplification) at high M_A. For high M_A, the B-field grows exponentially and saturates at equipartition with turbulence, while the vorticity jumps sharply at the shock and subsequently decays; the resulting field is orientated predominately along the shock normal (an effect only apparent in 3D and not 2D). This agrees with the radial field bias seen in supernova remnants. By contrast, for low M_A, field amplification is mostly compressional, relatively modest, and results in a predominantly perpendicular field. The latter is consistent with the polarization seen in radio relics. Our results are relatively robust to the assumed level of gas clumping. Our results imply that the turbulent dynamo may be important for supernovae, but is only consistent with the field strength, and not geometry, for cluster radio relics. For the latter, this implies strong pre-existing B-fields in the ambient cluster outskirts.},

  Abstract                 = { Aims: To increase the observational samples of star formation around expanding H ii regions, we analyzed the interstellar medium and star formation around N22. Methods: We used data extracted from the seven large-scale surveys from infrared to radio wavelengths. In addition we used the JCMT observations of the J = 3-2 line of 12CO emission data released on CADC and the 12CO J = 2-1 and J = 3-2 lines observed by the KOSMA 3 m telescope. We performed a multiwavelength study of bubble N22. Results: A molecular shell composed of several clumps agrees very well with the border of N22, suggesting that its expansion is collecting the surrounding material. The high integrated 12CO line intensity ratio RICO(3 - 2)/ICO(2 - 1) (ranging from 0.7 to 1.14) implies that shocks have driven into the molecular clouds. We identify eleven possible O-type stars inside the H ii region, five of which are located in projection inside the cavity of the 20 cm radio continuum emission and are probably the exciting-star candidates of N22. Twenty-nine young stellar objects (YSOs) are distributed close to the dense cores of N22. We conclude that star formation is indeed active around N22; the formation of most of YSOs may have been triggered by the expanding of the H ii region. After comparing the dynamical age of N22 and the fragmentation time of the molecular shell, we suggest that radiation-driven compression of pre-existing dense clumps may be ongoing.},

  Abstract                 = {3C 397 is a radio and X-ray bright Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) with an unusual rectangular morphology. Our CO observation obtained with the Purple Mountain Observatory at Delingha, Qinghai Province, China reveals that the remnant is well confined in a cavity of molecular gas and embedded at the edge of a molecular cloud (MC) at the local standard of rest systemic velocity of ~32 km s-1. The cloud has a column density gradient increasing from southeast to northwest, perpendicular to the Galactic plane, in agreement with the elongation direction of the remnant. This systemic velocity places the cloud and SNR 3C 397 at a kinematic distance of ~10.3 kpc. The derived mean molecular density (~10-30 cm-3) explains the high volume emission measure of the X-ray emitting gas. A 12CO line broadening of the ~32 km s-1 component is detected at the westmost boundary of the remnant, which provides direct evidence of the SNR-MC interaction and suggests multi-component gas there with dense (~104 cm-3) molecular clumps. We confirm the previous detection of an MC at ~38 km s-1 to the west and south of the SNR and argue, based on H I self-absorption, that the cloud is located in the foreground of the remnant. A list of Galactic SNRs presently known and suggested to be in physical contact with environmental MCs is appended in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are commonly believed to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Despite intensive study of the non-thermal emission of many SNRs the identification of the accelerated particle type relies heavily on assumptions of ambient-medium parameters that are only loosely constrained. Compelling evidence of hadronic acceleration can be provided by detecting a strong roll-off in the secondary γ-ray spectrum below the {π }0 production threshold energy of about 135 MeV, the so called “pion bump.” Here we use five years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope data to study the spectrum above 60 MeV of the middle-aged SNR W51C. A clear break in the power-law γ-ray spectrum at {E}{{break}}=290+/- 20 {{MeV}} is detected with 9σ significance and we show that this break is most likely associated with the energy production threshold of {π }0mesons. A high-energy break in the γ-ray spectrum at about 2.7 GeV is found with 7.5σ significance. The spectral index at energies beyond this second break is {{{Γ }}}2={2.52}-0.07+0.06 and closely matches the spectral index derived by the MAGIC Collaboration above 75 GeV. Therefore our analysis provides strong evidence to explain the γ-ray spectrum of W51C by a single particle population of protons with a momentum spectrum best described by a broken power law with break momentum {p}{{break}}∼ 80 {{G}}{{e}}{{V}}/c. W51C is the third middle-aged SNR that displays compelling evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration and thus strengthens the case of SNRs as the main source of Galactic cosmic rays.},

The SNR is believed to be interacting with molecular clouds, based on 1720 MHz hydroxyl (OH) maser emission observations in its direction. This interaction is expected to provide targets for the production of γ-ray emission from π0-decay. A γ-ray source was observed in the direction of SNR G5.7-0.1, positioned near the bright γ-ray source SNR W28. We model the emission from radio to γ-ray energies using a one-zone model. Following consideration of both π0-decay and leptonically dominated emission scenarios for the MeV-TeV source, we conclude that a considerable component of the γ-ray emission must originate from the π0-decay channel. Finally, constraints were placed on the reported ambiguity of the SNR distance through X-ray column density measurements made using XMM-Newton observations. We conclude G5.7-0.1 is a significant γ-ray source positioned at a distance of ˜3 kpc with luminosity in the 0.1-100 GeV range of Lγ ≈ 7.4 × 1034 erg s-1.},

  Abstract                 = {We present two-dimensional MHD simulations of the evolution of a young Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) during its interaction with an interstellar cloud of comparable size at impact. We include for the first time in such simulations explicit relativistic electron transport. This was done using a simplified treatment of the diffusion-advection equation, thus allowing us to model injection and acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons at shocks and their subsequent transport. From this information we also model radio synchrotron emission, including spectral information. The simulations were carried out in spherical coordinates with azimuthal symmetry and compare three different situations, each incorporating an initially uniform interstellar magnetic field oriented in the polar direction on the grid. In particular, we modeled the SNR-cloud interactions for a spherical cloud on the polar axis, a toroidal cloud whose axis is aligned with the polar axis, and, for comparison, a uniform medium with no cloud. We find that the evolution of the overrun cloud qualitatively resembles that seen in simulations of simpler but analogous situations: that is, the cloud is crushed and begins to be disrupted by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, we demonstrate here that, in addition, the internal structure of the SNR is severely distorted as such clouds are engulfed. This has important dynamical and observational implications. The principal new conclusions we draw from these experiments are the following. (1) Independent of the cloud interaction, the SNR reverse shock can be an efficient site for particle acceleration in a young SNR. (2) The internal flows of the SNR become highly turbulent once it encounters a large cloud. (3) An initially uniform magnetic field is preferentially amplified along the magnetic equator of the SNR, primarily because of biased amplification in that region by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. A similar bias produces much greater enhancement to the magnetic energy in the SNR during an encounter with a cloud when the interstellar magnetic field is partially transverse to the expansion of the SNR. The enhanced magnetic fields have a significant radial component, independent of the field orientation external to the SNR. This leads to a strong equatorial bias in synchrotron brightness that could easily mask any enhancements to electron-acceleration efficiency near the magnetic equator of the SNR. Thus, to establish the latter effect, it will be essential to establish that the magnetic field in the brightest regions are actually tangential to the blast wave. (4) The filamentary radio structures correlate well with ``turbulence-enhanced'' magnetic structures, while the diffuse radio emission more closely follows the gas-density distribution within the SNR. (5) At these early times, the synchrotron spectral index due to electrons accelerated at the primary shocks should be close to 0.5 unless those shocks are modified by cosmic-ray proton pressures. While that result is predictable, we find that this simple result can be significantly complicated in practice by SNR interactions with clouds. Those events can produce regions with significantly steeper spectra. Especially if there are multiple cloud encounters, this interaction can lead to nonuniform spatial spectral distributions or, through turbulent mixing, produce a spectrum that is difficult to relate to the actual strength of the blast wave. (6) Interaction with the cloud enhances the nonthermal electron population in the SNR in our simulations because of additional electron injection taking place in the shocks associated with the cloud. Together with point 3, this means that SNR-cloud encounters can significantly increase the radio emission from the SNR.},

  Abstract                 = {Young supernova remnants such as Tycho generally exhibit a bright circular clumpy shell in both radio and X-ray emission. For several young remnants, various arguments suggest that the magnetic field is larger than can be explained by compression of a few microgauss ambient magnetic field by the shock wave. Radio polarization studies reveal a net radial orientation of magnetic fields in the shell which cannot be explained by the simple compression either. We model Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the interface of the ejecta and the shocked ambient medium to explain these observations. We have performed multidimensional MHD simulations of the instability in the shell of a Type I supernova remnant for the first time utilizing a moving grid technique which allows us to follow the growth of the instability and its effect on the local magnetic field in detail. We find that the evolution of the instability is very sensitive to the deceleration of the ejecta and the evolutionary stage of the remnant. As the reverse shock enters the inner uniform density region, Chevalier's self-similar stage ends and the thickness of radio shell increases and the instability weakens. Our simulation shows that Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities amplify ambient magnetic fields locally by as much as a factor of 60 around dense figures due to stretching, winding, and compression. Globally, the amount of magnetic field amplification is low and the magnetic energy density reaches only about 0.3% of the turbulent energy density at the end of simulation. Strong magnetic field lines draped around the fingers produce the radial B vector polarization, whereas thermal bremsstrahlung from the dense fingers themselves produces the clumpy X-ray emission. As a result, the X-ray emission peaks inside of the radio emission. The surface brightness profile shows no detailed correspondence between radio and X-ray emission. The major part of radio and X-ray luminosity comes from the mixing region.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the radio emission from young supernova remnants by means of three-dimensional numerical MHD simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the shell of the remnant. The computation is carried out in spherical polar coordinates (r, θ, φ) by using a moving grid technique that allows us to resolve the shell finely. The three-dimensional result shows more turbulent (complex) structures in the mixing region than the two-dimensional result, and the instability is found to deform the reverse shock front Stokes parameters (I, Q, and U) are computed to study the radio properties of the remnant. The total intensity map shows two distinctive regions (inner and outer shells). The inner shell appears to be complex and turbulent, exhibiting loop structures and plumes as a result of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, while the outer shell is faint and laminar because of the shocked uniform ambient magnetic fields. The inner shell resembles the observed radio structure in the main shell of young SNRs, which is evidence that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is an ongoing process in young SNRs. When only the peculiar components of the magnetic fields generated by the instability are considered, the polarization B-vector in the inner radio shell is preferentially radial with about 20%-50% of fractional polarization, which is higher than the observed value. The fractional polarization is lowest in the turbulent inner shell and increases outward, which is attributed to the geometric effect The polarized intensity is found to be correlated with the total intensity. We demonstrate that the polarized intensity from the turbulent region can dominate over the polarized intensity from the shocked uniform fields if the amplified field is sufficiently strong. Therefore, we conclude that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability can explain the dominant radial magnetic field in the main shell of young supernova remnants. However, the outer faint shell shows a dominant tangential field orientation due to the shock-compression because this region is not mixed by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which is contrary to observations. Therefore, another mechanism is necessary to produce the radial components of the magnetic field at the outer shock, which we suggest to be a clumpy medium model.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: Gas within a galaxy is forced to establish pressure balance against gravitational forces. The shape of an unperturbed gaseous disk can be used to constrain dark matter models. Aims: We derive the 3D HI volume density distribution for the Milky Way out to a galactocentric radius of 40 kpc and a height of 20 kpc to constrain the Galactic mass distribution. Methods: We used the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. The transformation from brightness temperatures to densities depends on the rotation curve. We explored several models, reflecting different dark matter distributions. Each of these models was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in a self-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. Results: Besides a massive extended halo of M ˜ 1.8 × 1012 M⊙, we find a self-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 × 1011 M⊙, including a dark matter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 × 1010 M⊙. The existence of the ring was previously postulated from EGRET data and coincides with a giant stellar structure that surrounds the Galaxy. The resulting Milky Way rotation curve is flat up to R ˜ 27 kpc and slowly decreases outwards. The HI gas layer is strongly flaring. The HWHM scale height is 60 pc at R = 4 kpc and increases to ~2700 pc at R = 40 kpc. Spiral arms cause a noticeable imprint on the gravitational field, at least out to R = 30 kpc. Conclusions: Our mass model supports previous proposals that the giant stellar ring structure is due to a merging dwarf galaxy. The fact that the majority of the dark matter in the Milky Way for R ⪉ 40 kpc can be successfully modeled by a self-gravitating isothermal disk raises the question of whether this massive disk may have been caused by similar merger events in the past. The substructure in the Galactic dark matter disk suggests a dissipative nature for the dark matter disk.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a cosmic ray (CR) shock code in one-dimensional spherical geometry with which the particle distribution, the gas flow and their nonlinear interaction can be followed numerically in a frame comoving with an expanding shock. In order to accommodate a very wide dynamic range of diffusion length scales in the CR shock problem, we have incorporated subzone shock tracking and adaptive mesh refinement techniques. We find the spatial grid resolution required for numerical convergence is less stringent in this code compared to typical, fixed-grid Eulerian codes. The improved convergence behavior derives from maintaining the shock discontinuity inside the same grid zone in the comoving code. That feature improves numerical estimates of the compression rate experienced by CRs crossing the subshock compared to codes that allow the subshock to drift on the grid. Using this code with a Bohm-like diffusion model we have calculated the CR acceleration and the nonlinear feedback at supernova remnant shocks during the Sedov-Taylor stage. Similarly to plane-parallel shocks, with an adopted thermal leakage injection model, about 10 -3 of the particles that pass through the shock and up to 60% of the explosion energy are transferred to the CR component. These results are in good agreement with previous nonlinear spherical CR shock calculations of Berezhko and collaborators.},

Derived continuum spectra and observed morphologies indicate that G348.5 + 0.1 (CTB 37A) does not have a 'jet' as reported by previous observers but is instead superposed on a second, previously unidentified SNR lying along the line of sight. This new SNR is designated G348.5 - 0.0 according to the usual convention. Other observers have also noted a faint, flat spectrum bridge of emission possibly connecting the G348.5 + 0.1/G348.5 - 0.0 superposition with a third nearby remnant G348.7 + 0.3 (CTB 37B). However, a connection appears unlikely, and it is suggested that the 'bridge' merely consists of faint emission which has 'leaked' from the southeastern side of G348.7 + 0.3 and has no relation to the G348.5 + 0.1/G348.5 - 0.0 superposition. These new data also reveal a remarkable region of 'blown-out' emission from the southwestern part of G348.5 + 0.1 which most likely reflects the presence of large-scale density inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium into which the SNR shell is expanding.},

These observations are part of a systematic survey for broad molecular line (BML) regions indicative of interactions with molecular clouds (MCs). We detected BML regions toward 19 SNRs, including 9 newly identified BML regions associated with SNRs (G08.3-0.0, G09.9-0.8, G11.2-0.3, G12.2+0.3, G18.6-0.2, G23.6+0.3, 4C-04.71, G29.6+0.1, and G32.4+0.1). The remaining 10 SNRs with BML regions confirm previous evidence for MC interaction in most cases (G16.7+0.1, Kes 75, 3C 391, Kes 79, 3C 396, 3C 397, W49B, Cas A, and IC 443), although we confirm that the BML region toward HB 3 is associated with the W3(OH) H ii region, not the SNR. Based on the systemic velocity of each MC, molecular line diagnostics, and cloud morphology, we test whether these detections represent SNR-MC interactions. One of the targets (G54.1+0.3) had previous indications of a BML region, but we did not detect broadened emission toward it. Although broadened 12CO J = 2 - 1 line emission should be detectable toward virtually all SNR-MC interactions, we find relatively few examples; therefore, the number of interactions is low. This result favors mechanisms other than supernova feedback as the basic trigger for star formation. In addition, we find no significant association between TeV gamma-ray sources and MC interactions, contrary to predictions that SNR-MC interfaces are the primary venues for cosmic ray acceleration.},

The point source was discovered in 2005 in shorter Chandra observations and was hypothesized to be a neutron star associated with the SNR. Our X-ray spectral analysis strongly supports the hypothesis of a thermally emitting neutron star associated with G15.9+0.2. We conclude that the object belongs to the class of young cooling low-magnetized neutron stars referred to as central compact objects (CCOs). We modeled the spectrum of the neutron star with a blackbody spectral function and with our hydrogen and carbon neutron star atmosphere models, assuming that the radiation is uniformly emitted by the entire stellar surface. Under this assumption, only the carbon atmosphere models yield a distance that is compatible with a source located in the Galaxy. In this respect, CXOU J181852.0-150213 is similar to two other well-studied CCOs, the neutron stars in Cas A and in HESS J1731-347, for which carbon atmosphere models were used to reconcile their emission with the known or estimated distances.},

Here we resolve the ambiguity for 49 H II region complexes with known recombination-line velocities in the first Galactic quadrant. We measured the 21 cm H I absorption spectrum toward each source with the Very Large Array in the C array. The maximum velocity of H I absorption was used to discriminate between the near and far kinematic distances. The number ratio of far to near sources, ~3, can be entirely explained as a geometrical effect. The kinematic distances that we derive are compared with previous determinations for the same sources. Although our distance determinations are largely in agreement with previous measurements, there are 22 discrepancies that we discuss. Using our distance determinations, we create a face-on Galactic map of the H II region complexes and compare it with a kinematically derived profile of the distribution of CO-traced molecular hydrogen. The H II region complexes delineate the large-scale features seen in the molecular gas. The 5 kpc molecular ring and the Sagittarius spiral arm are clearly evident, and a few H II region complexes lie in the Perseus arm.},

  Abstract                 = {We have carried out ROSAT X-ray observations of the W51C supernova remnant (SNR). The SNR appears as an elongated (50' × 38') structure along the east-west direction. In contrast to its shell-type morphology in radio continuum, the SNR has both center-filled and shell-type morphologies in X-ray structure. The boundary of the radio structure matches well with that of the X-ray in the southeast. To the west, the X-ray structure appears to extend beyond the radio continuum shell. High-resolution (40") interferometric 21 cm continuum observation shows a thin shell located within the X-ray structure. The thin shell appears to surround the central X-ray-bright region. The X-ray spectrum of the SNR becomes systematically harder toward the west. By comparing the spectral hardness with the distribution of molecular gas in this region, we have found that the spectral hardening is due to the selective absorption by intervening interstellar gas. The W51C SNR is considered to be behind the "high-velocity molecular stream" at a mean distance of 5.6 kpc. The average X-ray spectrum of the SNR can be fitted well by the Raymond-Smith thermal model with Te = 3.4 × 106 K. We apply the Sedov and evaporative (White & Long 1991) models to derive the SNR parameters. Both models yield an age of ˜3 × 104 yr and an explosion energy of 3.6 × 1051 ergs, which is larger than the canonical value of a single supernova explosion. We discuss the implications of the large energy requirement and the complex X-ray and radio morphologies.},

Taking into account all significant contributions to the total radio emission, such as by the geomagnetic effect, the charge excess, and the atmospheric refraction we parameterize the radio LDF. This parameterization is two-dimensional and has several free parameters. The large number of free parameters is not suitable for experiments of sparse arrays operating at low SNR (signal-to-noise ratios). Thus, exploiting symmetries, we decrease the number of free parameters and reduce the LDF to a simple one-dimensional function. The remaining parameters can be fit with a small number of points, i.e. as few as the signal from three antennas above detection threshold. Finally, we present a method for the reconstruction of air-shower parameters, in particular, energy and $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ (shower maximum), which can be reached with a theoretical accuracy of better than 15\% and 30~g/cm$^2$, respectively.},

Here we report X-ray observations of the remnant of supernova 1006, made by the ASCA satellite, which indicate that emission from the edges of the remnant shell is dominated by radiation from electrons accelerated to energies of ˜ 100 TeV within the shock front. Ions in the shell are likely to have been accelerated to similar energies, thus giving rise to very-high-energy cosmic rays.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the bright burst detected by four Interplanetary network (IPN) spacecraft on 2015 April 12. The IPN localization of the source is consistent with the position of the recently discovered soft gamma-repeater SGR 1935+2154. From the Konus-Wind (KW) observation, we derive temporal and spectral parameters of the emission, and the burst energetics. The rather long duration of the burst (˜1.7 s) and the large measured energy fluence (˜2.5 × 10-5 erg cm-2) put it in the class of rare `intermediate' soft gamma-repeater (SGR) flares, and this is the first one observed from SGR 1935+2154. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the KW light curve yields no statistically significant signal. Of four spectral models tested, optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung and a single blackbody (BB) function can be rejected on statistical grounds; two more complex models, a cutoff power law (CPL) and a sum of two BB functions (2BB), fit the burst spectra well and neither of them may be ruled out by the KW observation. The CPL and 2BB model parameters we report for this bright flare are typical of SGRs; they are also consistent with those obtained from observations of much weaker and shorter SGR 1935+2154 bursts with other instruments. From the distribution of 2BB spectral fit parameters we estimate the SGR 1935+2154 distance to be <10.0 kpc, in agreement with that of the Galactic supernova remnant G57.2+0.8 at 9.1 kpc.},

The pulsar has the highest spin-down luminosity (Ė = 8.3 × 1036 ergs s-1) among all the high magnetic field pulsars (HBPs) and has been classified as a Crab-like pulsar despite its magnetic field (5 × 10 13 G) being above the quantum critical field. It is the only HBP described by a nonthermal Crab-like spectrum, powering a bright pulsar wind nebula (PWN). Our spectroscopic study shows evidence of spectral softening (photon index Γ = 1.32+0.08-0.09 to 1.97+0.05-0.07) and temporal brightening [unabsorbed flux Funabs = (4.3 +/- 0.2) × 10-12 to 2.7+0.1-0.2 × 10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1] of the pulsar by ~6 times from 2000 to 2006. The 0.5-10 keV luminosity of the pulsar at the revised distance of 6 kpc has also increased from LX = (1.85 +/- 0.08) × 1034 to 1.16+0.03-0.07 × 1035 ergs s-1, and the X-ray efficiency increased from 0.2% +/- 0.01% to 1.4+0.04-0.08%. The observed X-ray brightening and softening of the pulsar suggests for the first time that this HBP is revealing itself as a magnetar.},

Our observations reveal four new, embedded clusters and provide a new high-resolution (0.35 arcsec) view of the W51 IRS2 (G49.5 - 0.4) region. The cluster associated with G48.9 - 0.3 is found to be a double cluster enclosed in a nest of near-infrared nebulosity. We construct stellar surface density maps for four major clusters in the W51 GMC. These unveil the underlying hierarchical structure. Colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams for each of these clusters show clear differences in the embedded stellar populations and indicate the relative ages of these clusters. In particular, the clusters associated with the HII regions G48.9 - 0.3 and G49.0 - 0.3 are found to have a high fraction of young stellar objects and are therefore considered the youngest of all the near-infrared clusters in the W51 GMC. The estimated masses of the individual clusters, when summed, yield a total stellar mass of ~104 Msolar in the W51 GMC, implying a star formation efficiency of 5-10 per cent. These results, in comparison with the CO observations of the W51 GMC, suggest for the first time that star formation in the W51 GMC is probably triggered by a galactic spiral density wave.},

  Abstract                 = {We present intermediate results from a long-term program of mapping the neutral absorption characteristics of the local interstellar medium, motivated by the availability of accurate and consistent parallaxes from the Hipparcos satellite. Equivalent widths of the interstellar NaI D-line doublet at 5890 Å are presented for the lines-of-sight towards some 311 new target stars lying within ~ 350 pc of the Sun. Using these data, together with NaI absorption measurements towards a further ~ 240 nearby targets published in the literature (for many of them, in the directions of molecular clouds), and the ~ 450 lines-of-sight already presented by (Sfeir et al. \cite{sfeir99}), we show 3D absorption maps of the local distribution of neutral gas towards 1005 sight-lines with Hipparcos distances as viewed from a variety of different galactic projections. The data are synthesized by means of two complementary methods, (i) by mapping of iso-equivalent width contours, and (ii) by density distribution calculation from the inversion of column-densities, a method devised by Vergely et al. (\cite{vergely01}). Our present data confirms the view that the local cavity is deficient in cold and neutral interstellar gas. The closest dense and cold gas ``wall'', in the first quadrant, is at ~ 55-60 pc. There are a few isolated clouds at closer distance, if the detected absorption is not produced by circumstellar material. The maps reveal narrow or wide ``interstellar tunnels'' which connect the Local Bubble to surrounding cavities, as predicted by the model of Cox & Smith (1974). In particular, one of these tunnels, defined by stars at 300 to 600 pc from the Sun showing negligible sodium absorption, connects the well known CMa void (Gry et al. \cite{gry85}), which is part of the Local Bubble, with the supershell GSH 238+00+09 (Heiles \cite{heiles98}). High latitude lines-of-sight with the smallest absorption are found in two ``chimneys'', whose directions are perpendicular to the Gould belt plane. The maps show that the Local Bubble is ``squeezed'' by surrounding shells in a complicated pattern and suggest that its pressure is smaller than in those expanding regions. We discuss the locations of several HI and molecular clouds. Using comparisons between NaI and HI or CO velocities, in some cases we are able to improve the constraints on their distances. According to the velocity criteria, MBM 33-37, MBM 16-18, UT 3-7, and MBM 54-55 are closer than ~ 100 pc, and MBM 40 is closer than 80 pc. Dense HI clouds are seen at less than 90 pc and 85 pc in the directions of the MBM 12 and MBM 41-43 clouds respectively, but the molecular clouds themselves may be far beyond. The above closest molecular clouds are located at the neutral boundary of the Bubble. Only one translucent cloud, G192-67, is clearly embedded within the LB and well isolated. These maps of the distribution of local neutral interstellar NaI gas are also briefly compared with the distribution of both interstellar dust and neutral HI gas within 300 pc.

  Abstract                 = {The carbon isotopic ratio across the Galaxy was studied by observing nine interstellar clouds in the doubly rare isotope of carbon monoxide, C-13/O-18, and in the rare isotopic species C-12/O-18. The goal in this study was to improve the data from optically thin carbon monoxide emissions. A systematic gradient is found in the C-12/C-13 isotopic ratio across the Galaxy, ranging from about 30 in the inner part at 5 kpc to about 70 at 12 kpc, with a Galactic center value of 24. Near the solar radius the average ratio is 57, but it is somewhat larger, about 67, in Orion. Carbon monoxide isotopic ratios are smaller than those of formaldehyde, but they have roughly the same slope across the Galaxy. The result of 57 for the local CO ratio lies between the values from various CH(+) absorption measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Dust formation in supernova ejecta is currently the leading candidate to explain the large quantities of dust observed in the distant, early universe. However, it is unclear whether the ejecta-formed dust can survive the hot interior of the supernova remnant (SNR). We present infrared observations of ~0.02 solar masses of warm (~100 kelvin) dust seen near the center of the ~10,000-year-old Sagittarius A East SNR at the Galactic center. Our findings indicate the detection of dust within an older SNR that is expanding into a relatively dense surrounding medium (electron density ~103 centimeters-3) and has survived the passage of the reverse shock. The results suggest that supernovae may be the dominant dust-production mechanism in the dense environment of galaxies of the early universe.},

The resulting age distribution yields a SNR birthrate of 1/(500 yr) for the LMC. The explosion energy distribution is well fit by a log-normal distribution, with a most-probable explosion energy of 0.5× {10}51 erg, with a 1σ dispersion by a factor of 3 in energy. The circumstellar medium density distribution is broader than the explosion energy distribution, with a most-probable density of ˜0.1 cm-3. The shape of the density distribution can be fit with a log-normal distribution, with incompleteness at high density caused by the shorter evolution times of SNRs.},

We provide a new distance estimate to the SNR/pulsar system by analyzing the HI and 13CO maps, the HI emission and absorption spectra, and the 13CO emission spectrum of Kes 75. That there are no absorption features at negative velocities strongly argues against the widely-used large distance of 19 to 21 kpc for Kes 75, and shows that Kes 75 is within the Solar circle, i.e. a distance d < 13.2 kpc. Kes 75 is likely at a distance of 5.1 to 7.5 kpc because the highest HI absorption velocity is at 95 km s-1, and no absorption is associated with a nearby HI emission peak at 102 km s-1 in the direction of Kes 75. This distance to Kes 75 gives a reasonable luminosity of PSR J1846-0258 and its PWN and also leads to a much smaller radius for Kes 75, so the age of the SNR is consistent with the spin-down age of PSR J1846-0258, confirming this pulsar as the second-youngest in the Galaxy.},

In addition, alternate evolutionary models are available, including evolution in a cloudy ISM, the fractional energy-loss model, and evolution in a hot low-density ISM.

The inferred ambient density structure is consistent with models for the circumstellar wind of a massive progenitor star rather than for a uniform interstellar medium. The estimated wind density (n H = 0.1-0.3 cm-3) at the current outer radius (~ 7.7 pc) of the remnant is consistent with a slow wind from a red supergiant (RSG) star. The total mass of the wind is estimated to be ~15-40 M sun (depending on the estimated density range), assuming that the wind extended down to near the surface of the progenitor.

In this paper, we improve the model by incorporating the finite volume of molecular clouds, demonstrate the model dependence on particle diffusion parameters and cloud size, and apply it to nine interacting SNRs (W28, W41, W44, W49B, W51C, Cygnus Loop, IC443, CTB 37A and G349.7+0.2). This refined model naturally explains the GeV spectral breaks and, in particular, the 'platforms', together with available TeV data. We find that the index of the diffusion coefficient δ is in the range 0.5-0.7, similar to the Galactic averaged value, and the diffusion coefficient for cosmic rays around the SNRs is essentially two orders of magnitude lower than the Galactic average (χ˜ 0.01), which is a good indication for the suppression of cosmic-ray diffusion near SNRs.},

  Abstract                 = {W28 is one of the archetypal supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds (MCs). HESS observation found four TeV sources which are coincident with the MCs around W28, but Fermi LAT detected no prominent GeV counterparts for two of them. An accumulative diffusion model is established in this Letter, and the energetic protons colliding with the nearby MCs are considered to be an accumulation of the diffusive protons escaping from the shock front throughout the history of the SNR expansion. We have fitted the γ-ray spectra of the four sources and naturally explained the GeV spectral break of the north-eastern source (source N) and the non-significant GeV emission of southern sources A and C. The distances of sources A and C from the SNR centre are found to be much larger than those of sources N and B, which may be the basic reason for the faint GeV γ-rays of the two former sources.},

  Abstract                 = {Detecting supernova remnant (SNR) candidates in the interstellar medium is a challenging task because SNRs have weak radio signals and irregular shapes. The use of a convolutional neural network is a deep learning method that can help us extract various features from images. To extract SNRs from astronomical images and estimate the positions of SNR candidates, we design the SNR-Net model composed of a training component and a detection component. In addition, transfer learning is used to initialize the network parameters, which improves the speed and accuracy of network training. We apply a T-T plot (of the different brightness temperatures of map pixels at two different frequencies) to calculate the spectral index of SNR candidates. To accelerate the scientific computing process, we take advantage of innovative hardware architecture, such as deep learning optimized graphics processing units, which increases the speed of computation by a factor of 5. A case study suggests that SNR-Net may be applicable to detecting extended sources in the images automatically.},

  Abstract                 = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the most important acceleration sites for cosmic rays (CRs) below ˜1015 eV in the Galaxy. High-energy photons, either directly from the shocks of the SNRs or indirectly from the interaction between SNRs and the nearby clouds, are crucial probes for the CR acceleration. Big progresses on observations of SNRs have been achieved by space- and ground-based γ-ray facilities. However, whether γ-rays come from accelerated hadrons or not, as well as their connection with the CRs observed at Earth, remains in debate. Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), a next-generation experiment, is designed to survey the northern part of the very high energy γ-ray sky from ˜0.3 TeV to PeV with the sensitivity of ≲1% of the Crab Nebula flux. In this paper, we indicate that LHAASO will be dedicated to enlarging the γ-ray SNR samples and improving the spectral and morphological measurements. These measurements, especially at energies above 30 TeV, will be important for us to finally understand the CR acceleration in SNRs.},

The presence of the maser implies moderate temperatures (50-125 K) and densities (~105 cm-3) and OH column densities of order 1016 cm-2. We show that these conditions can exist only if the shocks are of C-type. J-shocks fail by such a wide margin that the presence of this maser could become the most powerful indicator of C-shocks. These conditions also mean that the 1720 MHz maser will be inherently weak compared with the other ground-state OH masers. All the model predictions are in good agreement with the observations.},

The temperatures are quite high - in the range T˜ 2000-3000 K, just below the H2 dissociation temperature. This is the temperature range over which the H2 1-0 S(1) line at λ2.121 μm has its maximum emissivity per unit mass, so there may be many additional H2 cores with lower temperatures that are too faint to detect. We also measured the electron density in adjacent ionized gas, which on the assumption of gas pressure balance indicates densities in the molecular region nmol˜ 20 000 H baryons cm-3, although this really is just a lower limit since the H2 gas may be confined by other means. The excited region may be just a thin skin on a much more extensive blob of molecular gas that does not have the correct temperature and density to be as easily detectable. At the opposite extreme, the observed knots could consist of a fine mist of molecular gas in which we are detecting essentially all of the H2. Future CO observations could distinguish between these two cases. The Crab filaments serve as the nearby laboratories for understanding the very much larger filamentary structures that have formed in the intracluster medium of cool-core galaxy clusters.},

We use our mosaics to characterize the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and its three-dimensional structure, the ionizational structure in the filaments forming at its periphery, the speed of the shock driven by the PWN into surrounding ejecta (by inferring the cooling rates behind the shock), and the morphology and ionizational structure of the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) fingers. We quantify a number of asymmetries between the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) quadrants of the Crab Nebula. The lack of observed filaments in the NW, and our observations of the spatial extent of [O III] emission lead us to conclude that cooling rates are slower, and therefore the shock speeds are greater, in the NW quadrant of the nebula, compared with the SE. We conclude that R-T fingers are longer, more ionizationally stratified, and apparently more massive in the NW than in the SE, and the R-T instability appears more fully developed in the NW.},

Existing radio polarization studies indicate that projected large-scale magnetic fields tend to orient in the radial direction with several percent in excess within shells of these SNRs. We propose in this Letter that magnetic fields in these young SNRs could mainly originate from magnetized envelopes or magnetospheres of their presupernova progenitors, presumably magnetic white dwarfs, and that magnetic fields entrained in stellar ejecta roughly scale as approximately r-1. The inferred excess of radial alignment for magnetic fields in these young SNRs could result from the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and/or the presence of large-scale random helices of magnetic field lines with their axes meandering through the SNR shell. Molecular clouds and clumps of stellar materials surrounding the presupernova progenitor could also produce radial magnetic fields from transverse fields as the SNR expands into the ISM.},

  Abstract                 = {Thermal X-ray emission from young supernova remnants (SNRs) is usually dominated by the emission lines of the supernova ejecta, which are widely believed to be crossed and thus heated by the inward-propagating reverse shock (RS). Previous works using X-ray imaging data have shown that the ejecta are heated by the RS by locating the peak emission region of the most recently ionized matter, which is found to be well separated toward the inside from the outermost boundary. Here we report the discovery of a systematic increase of the Sulfur (S) to Silicon (Si) Kα line flux ratio with radius in Tycho’s SNR. This allows us, for the first time, to present continuous radial profiles of the ionization age and, furthermore, the elapsed ionization time since the onset of the ionization, which gives the history of the propagation of the ionization front into the SNR ejecta.},

  Abstract                 = {Models of neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova explosions have matured considerably in recent years. Explosions of low-mass progenitors can routinely be simulated in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that these supernovae could be contributors of some lighter neutron-rich elements beyond iron. The explosion mechanism of more massive stars remains under investigation, although first 3D models of neutrino-driven explosions employing multi-group neutrino transport have become available. Together with earlier 2D models and more simplified 3D simulations, these have elucidated the interplay between neutrino heating and hydrodynamic instabilities in the post-shock region that is essential for shock revival. However, some physical ingredients may still need to be added/improved before simulations can robustly explain supernova explosions over a wide range of progenitors. Solutions recently suggested in the literature include uncertainties in the neutrino rates, rotation, and seed perturbations from convective shell burning. We review the implications of 3D simulations of shell burning in supernova progenitors for the `perturbations-aided neutrino-driven mechanism,' whose efficacy is illustrated by the first successful multi-group neutrino hydrodynamics simulation of an 18 solar mass progenitor with 3D initial conditions. We conclude with speculations about the impact of 3D effects on the structure of massive stars through convective boundary mixing.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach to understand the landscape of supernova explosion energies, ejected nickel masses, and neutron star birth masses. In contrast to other recent parametric approaches, our model predicts the properties of neutrino-driven explosions based on the pre-collapse stellar structure without the need for hydrodynamic simulations. The model is based on physically motivated scaling laws and simple differential equations describing the shock propagation, the contraction of the neutron star, the neutrino emission, the heating conditions, and the explosion energetics. Using model parameters compatible with multi-D simulations and a fine grid of thousands of supernova progenitors, we obtain a variegated landscape of neutron star and black hole formation similar to other parametrized approaches and find good agreement with semi-empirical measures for the `explodability' of massive stars. Our predicted explosion properties largely conform to observed correlations between the nickel mass and explosion energy. Accounting for the coexistence of outflows and downflows during the explosion phase, we naturally obtain a positive correlation between explosion energy and ejecta mass. These correlations are relatively robust against parameter variations, but our results suggest that there is considerable leeway in parametric models to widen or narrow the mass ranges for black hole and neutron star formation and to scale explosion energies up or down. Our model is currently limited to an all-or-nothing treatment of fallback and there remain some minor discrepancies between model predictions and observational constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {We present and discuss correlations for optical and near-infrared (5500-10030 Å) line intensity measurements at many positions in the Crab Nebula. These correlations suggest the existence of gas produced by a range of nuclear processing, from material in which synthesis ended with the CNO cycle, to some helium burning and nitrogen depletion, to regions containing enriched products of oxygen burning. The latter exhibit a gradual, linear rise of [Ni II] emission with increasing argon enrichment, whereas gas with less nuclear processing shows markedly different [Ni II] emission characteristics, including the highest derived abundances. This suggests two origins for stable, neutron-rich nickel in the nebula: a type of ``alpha-rich freeze out'' in the more highly processed material and possibly removal of ions from the neutron star in other regions. In addition, the data indicate that anomalously strong observed [C I] emission comes from broad, low-ionization H+ to H0 transition zones. Although the strongest He I emission could also be enhanced in similar low-ionization gas, correlations between relevant line ratios argue against that interpretation, strengthening the case for an exceptionally high helium mass fraction in some locations. This paper involves data obtained at the MDM Observatory and at the McDonald Observatory of The University of Texas at Austin.},

  Abstract                 = {The massive red supergiant W26 in Westerlund 1 is one of a growing number of red supergiants shown to have winds that are ionized from the outside in. The fate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation star formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al. (2014, Nature, 512, 282) showed that external photoionization can stall the wind of red supergiants and accumulate mass in a dense static shell. We use spherically symmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of an externally photoionized wind to predict the brightness distribution of Hα and [N II] emission arising from photoionized winds both with and without a dense shell. We analyse spectra of the Hα and [N II] emission lines in the circumstellar environment around W26 and compare them with simulations to investigate whether W26 has a wind that is confined by external photoionization. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense shell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities that are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (≳22 km s-1) do not form a dense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good tracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [N II] and Hα lines as a function of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when only the line flux is considered. The radial velocity of the simulated winds disagrees with observations, however: the brightest observed emission is blueshifted by ≈25 km s-1 relative to the radial velocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest emission at zero radial velocity because of limb brightening. Our results show that the bright nebula surrounding W26 must be asymmetric, and we suggest that it is confined by external ram pressure from the extreme wind of the nearby supergiant W9. We obtain a lower limit on the nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar. The line ratio strongly favours photoionization over shock ionization, and so even if the observed nebula is pressure confined there should still be an ionization front and a photoionization-confined shell closer to the star that is not resolved by the current observations, which could be tested with better spectral resolution and spatial coverage.

  Abstract                 = {Interstellar bubbles around O stars are driven by a combination of the star's wind and ionizing radiation output. The wind contribution is uncertain because the boundary between the wind and interstellar medium is difficult to observe. Mid-infrared observations (e.g., of the H ii region RCW 120) show arcs of dust emission around O stars, contained well within the H ii region bubble. These arcs could indicate the edge of an asymmetric stellar wind bubble, distorted by density gradients and/or stellar motion. We present two-dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations investigating the evolution of wind bubbles and H ii regions around massive stars moving through a dense (nH = 3000 cm-3), uniform medium with velocities ranging from 4 to 16 km s-1. The H ii region morphology is strongly affected by stellar motion, as expected, but the wind bubble is also very aspherical from birth, even for the lowest space velocity considered. Wind bubbles do not fill their H ii regions (we find filling factors of 10-20 per cent), at least for a main sequence star with mass M⋆ ~ 30 M⊙. Furthermore, even for supersonic velocities the wind bow shock does not significantly trap the ionization front. X-ray emission from the wind bubble is soft, faint, and comes mainly from the turbulent mixing layer between the wind bubble and the H ii region. The wind bubble radiates <1 per cent of its energy in X-rays; it loses most of its energy by turbulent mixing with cooler photoionized gas. Comparison of the simulations with the H ii region RCW 120 shows that its dynamical age is ≲0.4 Myr and that stellar motion ≲4 km s-1 is allowed, implying that the ionizing source is unlikely to be a runaway star but more likely formed in situ. The region's youth, and apparent isolation from other O or B stars, makes it very interesting for studies of massive star formation and of initial mass functions.

  Abstract                 = {Mid-infrared arcs of dust emission are often seen near ionizing stars within H II regions. A possible explanations for these arcs is that they could show the outer edges of asymmetric stellar wind bubbles. We use two-dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of wind bubbles within H II regions around individual stars to predict the infrared emission properties of the dust within the H II region. We assume that dust and gas are dynamically well-coupled and that dust properties (composition, size distribution) are the same in the H II region as outside it, and that the wind bubble contains no dust. We post-process the simulations to make synthetic intensity maps at infrared wavebands using the torus code. We find that the outer edge of a wind bubble emits brightly at 24 μm through starlight absorbed by dust grains and re-radiated thermally in the infrared. This produces a bright arc of emission for slowly moving stars that have asymmetric wind bubbles, even for cases where there is no bow shock or any corresponding feature in tracers of gas emission. The 24 μm intensity decreases exponentially from the arc with increasing distance from the star because the dust temperature decreases with distance. The size distribution and composition of the dust grains has quantitative but not qualitative effects on our results. Despite the simplifications of our model, we find good qualitative agreement with observations of the H II region RCW 120, and can provide physical explanations for any quantitative differences. Our model produces an infrared arc with the same shape and size as the arc around CD -38°11636 in RCW 120, and with comparable brightness. This suggests that infrared arcs around O stars in H II regions may be revealing the extent of stellar wind bubbles, although we have not excluded other explanations.},

A large simulation of a density field containing randomly generated clumps of gas is shown to naturally generate elephant trunks with certain clump configurations. These configurations are simulated in isolation and analysed in detail to show the formation mechanism and determine possible observational signatures. Pillars formed by the shadowing mechanism are shown to have rather different velocity profiles depending on the initial gas configuration, but asymmetries mean that the profiles also vary significantly with perspective, limiting their ability to discriminate between formation scenarios. Neutral and molecular gas cooling are shown to have a strong effect on these results.},

  Abstract                 = {Betelgeuse, a nearby red supergiant, is a fast-moving star with a powerful stellar wind that drives a bow shock into its surroundings. This picture has been challenged by the discovery of a dense and almost static shell that is three times closer to the star than the bow shock and has been decelerated by some external force. The two physically distinct structures cannot both be formed by the hydrodynamic interaction of the wind with the interstellar medium. Here we report that a model in which Betelgeuse's wind is photoionized by radiation from external sources can explain the static shell without requiring a new understanding of the bow shock. Pressure from the photoionized wind generates a standing shock in the neutral part of the wind and forms an almost static, photoionization-confined shell. Other red supergiants should have much more massive shells than Betelgeuse, because the photoionization-confined shell traps up to 35 per cent of all mass lost during the red supergiant phase, confining this gas close to the star until it explodes. After the supernova explosion, massive shells dramatically affect the supernova light curve, providing a natural explanation for the many supernovae that have signatures of circumstellar interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {A significant fraction of massive stars are moving supersonically through the interstellar medium (ISM), either due to disruption of a binary system or ejection from their parent star cluster. The interaction of their wind with the ISM produces a bow shock. In late evolutionary stages these stars may undergo rapid transitions from red to blue and vice versa on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, with accompanying rapid changes to their stellar winds and bow shocks. Recent three-dimensional simulations of the bow shock produced by the nearby runaway red supergiant (RSG) Betelgeuse, under the assumption of a constant wind, indicate that the bow shock is very young (<30, 000 years old), hence Betelgeuse may have only recently become an RSG. To test this possibility, we have calculated stellar evolution models for single stars which match the observed properties of Betelgeuse in the RSG phase. The resulting evolving stellar wind is incorporated into two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in which we model a runaway blue supergiant (BSG) as it undergoes the transition to an RSG near the end of its life. We find that the collapsing BSG wind bubble induces a bow shock-shaped inner shell around the RSG wind that resembles Betelgeuse's bow shock, and has a similar mass. Surrounding this is the larger-scale retreating bow shock generated by the now defunct BSG wind's interaction with the ISM. We suggest that this outer shell could explain the bar feature located (at least in projection) just in front of Betelgeuse's bow shock.},

Methods: EPIC data are used to investigate the morphological and spectral properties of the remnant, searching in particular for supernova ejecta and Fe K line emission. By comparing the SNR's X-ray absorption column density with the atomic and molecular gas distribution along the line of sight, we attempt to constrain the distance to the SNR. Results: Prominent line features reveal the presence of ejecta. Abundance ratios of Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca strongly suggest that the progenitor of SNR G15.9+0.2 was a massive star with a main sequence mass likely in the range 20-25 M⊙, strengthening the physical association with a candidate central compact object detected with Chandra. Using EPIC's collective power, Fe K line emission from SNR G15.9+0.2 is detected for the first time. We measure the line properties and find evidence for spatial variations. We discuss how the source fits within the sample of SNRs with detected Fe K emission and find that it is the core-collapse SNR with the lowest Fe K centroid energy. We also present some caveats regarding the use of Fe K line centroid energy as a typing tool for SNRs. Only a lower limit of 5 kpc is placed on the distance to SNR G15.9+0.2, constraining its age to tSNR ≳ 2 kyr.},

We discuss the implementation in GADGET-2 of molecular and metal cooling at temperatures lower than 104 K, following the time-dependent properties of the gas and pollution from stellar evolution. We have checked the validity of our scheme by comparing the results of some test runs with previous calculations of cosmic abundance evolution and structure formation, finding excellent agreement. We have also investigated the relevance of molecule and metal cooling in some specific cases, finding that inclusion of HD cooling results in a higher clumping factor of the gas at high redshifts, while metal cooling at low temperatures can have a significant impact on the formation and evolution of cold objects.},

  Abstract                 = {The origin of the strong magnetic fields measured in magnetars is one of the main uncertainties in the neutron star field. On the other hand, the recent discovery of a large number of such strongly magnetized neutron stars is calling for more investigation on their formation. The first proposed model for the formation of such strong magnetic fields in magnetars was through alpha-dynamo effects on the rapidly rotating core of a massive star. Other scenarios involve highly magnetic massive progenitors that conserve their strong magnetic moment into the core after the explosion, or a common envelope phase of a massive binary system. In this work, we do a complete re-analysis of the archival X-ray emission of the supernova remnants (SNRs) surrounding magnetars, and compare our results with all other bright X-ray emitting SNRs, which are associated with compact central objects (which are proposed to have magnetar-like B-fields buried in the crust by strong accretion soon after their formation), high-B pulsars and normal pulsars. We find that emission lines in SNRs hosting highly magnetic neutron stars do not differ significantly in elements or ionization state from those observed in other SNRs, neither averaging on the whole remnants, nor studying different parts of their total spatial extent. Furthermore, we find no significant evidence that the total X-ray luminosities of SNRs hosting magnetars, are on average larger than that of typical young X-ray SNRs. Although biased by a small number of objects, we found that for a similar age, there is the same percentage of magnetars showing a detectable SNR than for the normal pulsar population.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on an analysis of the gas and dust budget in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Recent observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the LMC. This is the first time we can quantitatively assess the gas and dust input from AGB stars over a complete galaxy, fully based on observations. The integrated mass-loss rate over all intermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich AGB candidates in the LMC is 8.5 × 10-3Msolaryr-1, up to 2.1 × 10-2Msolaryr-1. This number could be increased up to 2.7 × 10-2Msolaryr-1 if oxygen-rich stars are included. This is overall consistent with theoretical expectations, considering the star formation rate (SFR) when these low- and intermediate-mass stars where formed, and the initial mass functions. AGB stars are one of the most important gas sources in the LMC, with supernovae (SNe), which produces about 2-4 × 10-2Msolaryr-1. At the moment, the SFR exceeds the gas feedback from AGB stars and SNe in the LMC, and the current star formation depends on gas already present in the ISM. This suggests that as the gas in the ISM is exhausted, the SFR will eventually decline in the LMC, unless gas is supplied externally. Our estimates suggest `a missing dust-mass problem' in the LMC, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: the accumulated dust mass from AGB stars and possibly SNe over the dust lifetime (400-800Myr) is significant less than the dust mass in the ISM. Another dust source is required, possibly related to star-forming regions.},

The survey will consist of ~590 4.3°× 4.3° mosaic images with 45 × 45 cosec|δ| arcsec2 resolution, and a source catalogue. In this paper we describe the initial release (version 1.0) of the source catalogue consisting of 107 765 radio sources made by fitting elliptical Gaussians in 271 SUMSS 4.3°× 4.3° mosaics to a limiting peak brightness of 6 mJy beam-1 at δ<=-50° and 10 mJy beam-1 at δ > -50°. The catalogue covers approximately 3500 deg2 of the southern sky with δ<=-30°, about 43 per cent of the total survey area. Positions in the catalogue are accurate to within 1-2 arcsec for sources with peak brightness A843>= 20 mJy beam-1 and are always better than 10 arcsec. The internal flux density scale is accurate to within 3 per cent. Image artefacts have been classified using a decision tree, which correctly identifies and rejects spurious sources in over 96 per cent of cases. Analysis of the catalogue shows that it is highly uniform and is complete to 8 mJy at δ<=-50° and 18 mJy at δ > -50°. In this release of the catalogue about 7000 sources are found in the overlap region with the National Radio Astronomy Observatories Very Large Array Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz. We calculate a median spectral index of α=-0.83 between 1.4 GHz and 843 MHz. This version of the catalogue will be released via the World Wide Web with future updates as new mosaics are released.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a dust model for cosmological simulations implemented in the moving-mesh code AREPO and present a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations to study dust formation within galactic haloes. Our model accounts for the stellar production of dust, accretion of gas-phase metals on to existing grains, destruction of dust through local supernova activity, and dust driven by winds from star-forming regions. We find that accurate stellar and active galactic nuclei feedback is needed to reproduce the observed dust-metallicity relation and that dust growth largely dominates dust destruction. Our simulations predict a dust content of the interstellar medium which is consistent with observed scaling relations at z = 0, including scalings between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, dust mass and gas mass, dust-to-gas ratio and stellar mass, and dust-to-stellar mass ratio and gas fraction. We find that roughly two-thirds of dust at z = 0 originated from Type II supernovae, with the contribution from asymptotic giant branch stars below 20 per cent for z ≳ 5. While our suite of Milky Way-sized galaxies forms dust in good agreement with a number of key observables, it predicts a high dust-to-metal ratio in the circumgalactic medium, which motivates a more realistic treatment of thermal sputtering of grains and dust cooling channels.},

  Abstract                 = {Bubbles in the interstellar medium are produced by astrophysical sources, which continuously or explosively deposit large amounts of energy into the ambient medium. These expanding bubbles can drive shocks in front of them, the dynamics of which is markedly different from the widely used Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor blast wave solution. Here, we present the theory of a bubble-driven shock and show how its properties and evolution are determined by the temporal history of the source energy output, generally referred to as the source luminosity law, L(t). In particular, we find the analytical solutions for a driven shock in two cases: the self-similar scaling law, Lvprop(t/ts ) p (with p and ts being constants) and the finite activity time case, Lvprop(1 - t/ts )-p . The latter with p > 0 describes a finite-time-singular behavior, which is relevant to a wide variety of systems with explosive-type energy release. For both luminosity laws, we derived the conditions needed for the driven shock to exist and predict the shock observational signatures. Our results can be relevant to stellar systems with strong winds, merging neutron star/magnetar/black hole systems, and massive stars evolving to supernovae explosions.},

It is observed that the equatorial wisps and polar knots in the termination shock of the pulsar wind appear to fluctuate in brightness on kilosecond timescales. Maximum flux variations of +/-24%+/-4% and +/-14%+/-4% relative to the mean (in 1.2 ks) are measured for the wisps and knots, respectively, with the greatest statistical significance in the J band, where the nebula background is less prominent. The J and K' flux densities imply different near-infrared spectra for the nonthermal continuum emission from the wisps and the outermost polar knot (the ``sprite''), giving Fν~ν-0.56+/-0.12 and Fν~ν-0.21+/-0.13, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {In this Letter, we explore the hypothesis that the smooth appearance of bow shocks around some red supergiants (RSGs) might be caused by the ionization of their winds by external sources of radiation. Our numerical simulations of the bow shock generated by IRC -10414 (the first-ever RSG with an optically detected bow shock) show that the ionization of the wind results in its acceleration by a factor of 2, which reduces the difference between the wind and space velocities of the star and makes the contact discontinuity of the bow shock stable for a range of stellar space velocities and mass-loss rates. Our best-fitting model reproduces the overall shape and surface brightness of the observed bow shock and suggests that the space velocity and mass-loss rate of IRC -10414 are ≈50 km s-1 and ≈10-6 M⊙ yr-1, respectively, and that the number density of the local interstellar medium is ≈3 cm-3. It also shows that the bow shock emission comes mainly from the shocked stellar wind. This naturally explains the enhanced nitrogen abundance in the line-emitting material, derived from the spectroscopy of the bow shock. We found that photoionized bow shocks are ≈15-50 times brighter in optical line emission than their neutral counterparts, from which we conclude that the bow shock of IRC -10414 must be photoionized.},

  Abstract                 = {After the death of a runaway massive star, its supernova shock wave interacts with the bow shocks produced by its defunct progenitor, and may lose energy, momentum and its spherical symmetry before expanding into the local interstellar medium (ISM). We investigate whether the initial mass and space velocity of these progenitors can be associated with asymmetric supernova remnants. We run hydrodynamical models of supernovae exploding in the pre-shaped medium of moving Galactic core-collapse progenitors. We find that bow shocks that accumulate more than about 1.5 M⊙ generate asymmetric remnants. The shock wave first collides with these bow shocks 160-750 yr after the supernova, and the collision lasts until 830-4900 yr. The shock wave is then located 1.35-5 pc from the centre of the explosion, and it expands freely into the ISM, whereas in the opposite direction it is channelled into the region of undisturbed wind material. This applies to an initially 20 M⊙ progenitor moving with velocity 20 km s-1 and to our initially 40 M⊙ progenitor. These remnants generate mixing of ISM gas, stellar wind and supernova ejecta that is particularly important upstream from the centre of the explosion. Their light curves are dominated by emission from optically thin cooling and by X-ray emission of the shocked ISM gas. We find that these remnants are likely to be observed in the [O III] λ 5007 spectral line emission or in the soft energy-band of X-rays. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of observed Galactic supernova remnants such as 3C 391 and the Cygnus Loop.},

We explore how the mass-loss and space velocity of massive runaway stars affect the morphology of their bow shocks. We run two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations following the evolution of the circumstellar medium of these stars in the Galactic plane from the main sequence to the red supergiant phase. We find that thermal conduction is an important process governing the shape, size and structure of the bow shocks around hot stars, and that they have an optical luminosity mainly produced by forbidden lines, e.g. [O III]. The Hα emission of the bow shocks around hot stars originates from near their contact discontinuity. The Hα emission of bow shocks around cool stars originates from their forward shock, and is too faint to be observed for the bow shocks that we simulate. The emission of optically thin radiation mainly comes from the shocked ISM material. All bow shock models are brighter in the infrared, i.e. the infrared is the most appropriate waveband to search for bow shocks. Our study suggests that the infrared emission comes from near the contact discontinuity for bow shocks of hot stars and from the inner region of shocked wind for bow shocks around cool stars. We predict that, in the Galactic plane, the brightest, i.e. the most easily detectable bow shocks are produced by high-mass stars moving with small space velocities.},

Their strong stellar winds interact with their surroundings, where the typical strength of the local ISM magnetic field is about 3.5-7 μG, which can result in the formation of bow shock nebulae. We investigate the effects of such magnetic fields, aligned with the motion of the flow, on the formation and emission properties of these circumstellar structures. Our axisymmetric, magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with optically thin radiative cooling, heating and anisotropic thermal conduction show that the presence of the background ISM magnetic field affects the projected optical emission of our bow shocks at Hα and [O III] λ 5007 which become fainter by about 1-2 orders of magnitude, respectively. Radiative transfer calculations against dust opacity indicate that the magnetic field slightly diminishes their projected infrared emission and that our bow shocks emit brightly at 60 μm. This may explain why the bow shocks generated by ionizing runaway massive stars are often difficult to identify. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of the bow shock of ζ Ophiuchi and we support the interpretation of its imperfect morphology as an evidence of the presence of an ISM magnetic field not aligned with the motion of its driving star.},

The modular structure exploits a general framework for integrating a system of conservation laws, built on modern Godunov-type shock-capturing schemes. Although a plethora of numerical methods has been successfully developed over the past two decades, the vast majority shares a common discretization recipe, involving three general steps: a piecewise polynomial reconstruction followed by the solution of Riemann problems at zone interfaces and a final evolution stage.

The current release exploits, in addition to the static grid version of the code, the distributed infrastructure of the CHOMBO library for multidimensional parallel computations over block-structured, adaptively refined grids. We employ a conservative finite-volume approach where primary flow quantities are discretized at the cell center in a dimensionally unsplit fashion using the Corner Transport Upwind method. Time stepping relies on a characteristic tracing step where piecewise parabolic method, weighted essentially non-oscillatory, or slope-limited linear interpolation schemes can be handily adopted. A characteristic decomposition-free version of the scheme is also illustrated. The solenoidal condition of the magnetic field is enforced by augmenting the equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier providing propagation and damping of divergence errors through a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic explicit cleaning step. Among the novel features, we describe an extension of the scheme to include non-ideal dissipative processes, such as viscosity, resistivity, and anisotropic thermal conduction without operator splitting. Finally, we illustrate an efficient treatment of point-local, potentially stiff source terms over hierarchical nested grids by taking advantage of the adaptivity in time. Several multidimensional benchmarks and applications to problems of astrophysical relevance assess the potentiality of the AMR version of PLUTO in resolving flow features separated by large spatial and temporal disparities.},

This work continues the study of the properties of young, bright supernova remnants (SNRs) begun with 3C 391 (Moffett & Reynolds 1994). Here we present high-resolution images of total intensity, polarization, and spectral index of W49B. In large-scale morphology it is basically a box-shaped remnant expanding into an apparently inhomogeneous medium, but we also find small-scale structures, arcs and filaments, which lie interior to the outer shell in projection. The actual spatial position of the filaments is unknown, though we suspect that they are in the remnant interior rather than on the front or back face of the blast wave. In addition, their distribution in two dimensions suggests the projection of a helical structure. The shell edge, sharply rising in brightness for at least 3/4 of its circumference, still remains unresolved at our highest resolution (4 sec). This for our assumed distance of 8 kpc, the width of the region in which the emission appears is less than 0.16 pc, indicating short mean free paths for shock-accelerated electrons and high levels of MHD turbulence presumably causing the scattering. We find no polarized flux at 90 or 20 cm, with 3 sigma upper limits in polarized intensity of 36 mJy at 90 cm (45 sec resolution) and 7.2 mJy at 20 cm (5 sec resolution), or 22 micro-Jy/sq arcsec and 370 micro-jy/sq arcsec, respectively, for any emission extended on those scales. Polarized flux is present at 6 cm, but at a very low mean polarized fraction (total polarized flux divided by total flux) of 0.44% +/- 0.06%, which, as for 3C 391, is much lower than typical for bright SNRs at this frequency. The morphology in polarized intensity is poorly correlated with that in total intensity. We see excursions in the polarized fraction up to at least 10% in a few locations, but even where polarization is seen, typical levels are a few percent. Tangled or disordered magnetic fields in the emitting region of the radio shell may be responsible for depolarizing the radio synchrotron radiation, but some form of internal Faraday depolarization may also occur. We estimate the foreground Faraday rotation measure to be about -450 rad/sq m, similar to that found for 3C 391, which is also the Galactic plane and just about as distant. Spectral index images created from the total intensity images show that the spectral index across W49B is constant to within about Delta alpha approximately 0.1 in bright regions. This result weakly supports a common origin of the radio-emitting electrons, as in the blast wave, rather than in inhomogeneous turbulent regions of differing properties due to the stochastic (second-order Fermi) acceleration process. Variations at the level of Delta alpha approximately 0.1 are seen, but their significance is doubtful. New observations at 90 cm, using experimental three-dimensional imaging technology, may improve on this limit.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we have modelled the supernova remnant (SNR) G296.5+10, by means of 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. This remnant belongs to the bilateral SNR group and has an additional striking feature: the rotation measure (RM) in its eastern and western parts are very different. In order to explain both the morphology observed in radio-continuum and the RM, we consider that the remnant expands into a medium shaped by the superposition of the magnetic field of the progenitor star with a constant Galactic magnetic field. We have also carried out a polarization study from our MHD results, obtaining synthetic maps of the linearly polarized intensity and the Stokes parameters. This study reveals that both the radio morphology and the reported RM for G296.5+10 can be explained if the quasi-parallel acceleration mechanism is taking place in the shock front of this remnant.},

  Abstract                 = {The timescales to replenish dust from the cool winds of asymptotic giant branch stars are believed to be greater than the timescales for dust destruction. In high-redshift galaxies, this problem is further compounded as the stars take longer than the age of the universe to evolve into the dust production stages. To explain these discrepancies, dust formation in supernovae (SNe) is required to be an important process, but until recently dust in supernova remnants (SNRs) has only been detected in very small quantities. We present the first submillimeter observations of cold dust in Kepler's SNR using the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometric Array. A two-component dust temperature model is required to fit the spectral energy distribution with Twarm~102 K and Tcold~17 K. The total mass of dust implied for Kepler is ~1 Msolar-1000 times greater than previous estimates. Thus SNe, or their progenitors, may be important dust formation sites.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a spectral analysis of the Crab Nebula obtained with the Chandra X-ray observatory. The X-ray spectrum is characterized by a power law whose index varies across the nebula. The variation can be discussed in terms of the particle injection from the pulsar in two different directions: the equatorial plane containing the torus and the symmetry axis along the jet. In the equatorial plane, spectra within the torus are the hardest, with a photon index α~1.9, and are almost independent of the surface brightness. At the periphery of the torus, the spectrum gradually softens in the outer, lower surface brightness regions, up to α~3.0. This indicates that synchrotron losses become significant to X-ray-emitting particles at the outer boundary of the torus. We discuss the nature of the torus, incorporating information from observations at other wavelengths. Spectral variations are also seen within the southern jet. The core of the jet is the hardest, with α~2.0, and the outer sheath surrounding the core becomes softer with α up to 2.5 at the outermost part. Based on the similarity between the spectra of the jet core and the torus, we suggest that the electron spectra of the particles injected from the pulsar are also similar in these two different directions. The brightness ratio between the near and far sides of the torus can be explained by Doppler boosting and relativistic aberration; however, the observed ratio cannot be derived from the standard weakly magnetized pulsar wind model. We also found a site where an optical filament comprising supernova ejecta is absorbing the soft X-ray emission (<2 keV).},

When the fraction of particles which get accelerated is of the order of ~10-4, we find that the strength of the magnetic field obtained as a result of streaming instability induced by cosmic rays is compatible with the interpretation of the X-ray emitting filaments being produced by strong synchrotron losses in ~100μG magnetic fields. The maximum energy of accelerated protons is >~105 GeV. If the X-ray filaments are explained in alternative ways, the constraint on the magnetic field downstream of the shock disappears and the HESS data can be marginally fitted with ICS of relativistic electrons off a complex population of photons, tailored to comprise cosmic microwave background and ambient infrared/optical photons. The fit, typically poor at the highest energies, requires a large density of target photons within the remnant; only a fraction of the order of ~10-6 of the background particles gets accelerated; the local magnetic field is of the order of ~20μG and the maximum energy of protons is much lower than the knee energy. Current HESS gamma-ray observations combined with recent X-ray observations by Suzaku do not allow as yet to draw a definitive conclusion on whether RX J1713.7-3946 is an efficient cosmic ray accelerator, although at the present time a hadronic interpretation of HESS data seems more likely. We discuss the implications of our results for the GLAST gamma-ray telescope, which should be able to discriminate the two scenarios discussed above, by observing the shape of the gamma-ray spectrum at lower energies.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. Very recent gamma-ray observations of G120.1+1.4 (Tycho's) supernova remnant (SNR) by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS have provided new fundamental pieces of information for understanding particle acceleration and nonthermal emission in SNRs. Aims: We want to outline a coherent description of Tycho's properties in terms of SNR evolution, shock hydrodynamics, and multiwavelength emission by accounting for particle acceleration at the forward shock via first-order Fermi mechanism. Methods: We adopt here a quick and reliable semi-analytical approach to nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration. It includes magnetic field amplification due to resonant streaming instability and the dynamical backreaction on the shock of both cosmic rays (CRs) and self-generated magnetic turbulence. Results: We find that Tycho's forward shock accelerates protons up to at least 500 TeV, channelling into CRs about 10% of its kinetic energy. Moreover, the CR-induced streaming instability is consistent with all the observational evidence of very efficient magnetic field amplification (up to ~300 μG). In such a strong magnetic field, the velocity of the Alfvén waves scattering CRs in the upstream is expected to be enhanced and to make accelerated particles feel an effective compression factor lower than 4, in turn leading to an energy spectrum steeper than the standard prediction ∝ E-2. This effect is crucial for explaining GeV-to-TeV gamma-ray spectrum as the result of neutral pions decay produced in nuclear collisions between accelerated nuclei and the background gas. Conclusions: The self-consistency of such hadronic scenario, along with the inability of the concurrent leptonic mechanism (inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons on several photon backgrounds) to reproduce both the shape and the normalization of the detected gamma-ray emission, represents the first clear and direct radiative evidence that hadron acceleration occurs efficiently in young Galactic SNRs.},

This target is not only one of the brightest sources ever discovered in very high-energy gamma rays but also well observed in other wavebands. In X-rays, the emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation, which links directly to the existence of high-energy electrons. Radio observations of CO and HI gas have revealed a highly inhomogeneous medium surrounding the SNR, such as clumpy molecular clouds. Therefore gamma rays from hadronic interactions are naturally expected. However, the spectrum in GeV energy range measured by Fermi/LAT indicates more typical of leptonic emission from accelerated electrons. Despite lots of multi-wavelength information, the competing interpretations have led to much uncertainty in the quest of unraveling the true origin of the gamma-ray emission from RX~J1713.7--3946. CTA will achieve highest performance ever in sensitivity, angular resolution, and energy resolution. We estimate CTA capability to examine the emission mechanisms of the gamma rays through simulated spatial distribution, spectra, and their time variation.},

  Abstract                 = {We derived the three-dimensional distribution of H I gas in the Milky Way Galaxy using the latest H I survey data cubes and rotation curves. The distance of the H I gas was determined by the kinematic distance using a rotation curve. We solved the near-far problem in the inner Galaxy by a fitting method which involves introducing a model of vertical H I distribution. In our resultant maps we could trace three prominent arms: the Sagittarius-Carina arm, the Perseus arm, and the Outer arm. These three arms were found to be logarithmic spiral arms. The pitch angles of the Sagittarius-Carina, Perseus, and Outer arms were estimated to be about 11°, 18°, and 7°, respectively. The Sun is located in a region rich in H I gas between the Sagittarius-Carina arm and the Perseus arm. The H I disk shows large and asymmetric warping in the outer disk: the H I disk goes up to about 1.5kpc above the Galactic plane in the northern hemisphere, and down to about 1kpc in the southern hemisphere, which means asymmetric warping. The inner H I disk is also found to be tilting. The radius of the H I disk is about 17kpc and the H I mass within this radius is estimated to be 2.5 × 109 M⊙, which corresponds to 1.5% of the dynamical mass predicted from the rotation curve. We also found that the H I outskirt is largely swelling in the fourth quadrant, and hence the Galaxy is significantly lopsided. The scale-height of the H I layer increases with the radius, and is correlated with the H I volume density at the centroid of the H I layer.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims: We wish to study the spectral dependence of the radio emission from cosmic-ray air showers around 100 PeV (1017 eV). Methods: We observe short radio pulses in a broad frequency band with the dipole-interferometer LOPES (LOFAR Prototype Station), which is triggered by a particle detector array named Karlsruhe Shower Core and Array Detector (KASCADE). LOFAR is the Low Frequency Array. For this analysis, 23 strong air shower events are selected using parameters from KASCADE. The radio data are digitally beam-formed before the spectra are determined by sub-band filtering and fast Fourier transformation. Results: The resulting electric field spectra fall off to higher frequencies. An average electric field spectrum is fitted with an exponential Eν=K\cdotexp (ν/MHz/β) and β=-0.017±0.004, or alternatively, with a power law ɛν=K\cdotνα and a spectral index of α=-1±0.2. The spectral slope obtained is not consistent within uncertainties and it is slightly steeper than the slope obtained from Monte Carlo simulations based on air showers simulated with CORSIKA (Cosmic Ray Simulations for KASCADE). For the analyzed sample of LOPES events, we do not find any significant dependence of the spectral slope on the electric field amplitude, the azimuth angle, the zenith angle, the curvature radius, nor on the average distance of the antennae from the shower core position. But one of the strongest events was measured during thunderstorm activity in the vicinity of LOPES and shows the longest pulse length measured of 110 ns and a spectral slope of α=-3.6. Conclusions: We show with two different methods that frequency spectra from air shower radio emission can be reconstructed on event-by-event basis, with only two dozen dipole antennae simultaneously over a broad range of frequencies. According to the obtained spectral slopes, the maximum power is emitted below 40 MHz. Furthermore, the decrease in power to higher frequencies indicates a loss in coherence determined by the shower disc thickness. We conclude that a broader bandwidth, larger collecting area, and longer baselines, as will be provided by LOFAR, are necessary to further investigate the relation of the coherence, pulse length, and spectral slope of cosmic ray air showers.

  Abstract                 = {We present the second catalog of high-energy γ-ray sources detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi), derived from data taken during the first 24 months of the science phase of the mission, which began on 2008 August 4. Source detection is based on the average flux over the 24 month period. The second Fermi-LAT catalog (2FGL) includes source location regions, defined in terms of elliptical fits to the 95% confidence regions and spectral fits in terms of power-law, exponentially cutoff power-law, or log-normal forms. Also included are flux measurements in five energy bands and light curves on monthly intervals for each source. Twelve sources in the catalog are modeled as spatially extended. We provide a detailed comparison of the results from this catalog with those from the first Fermi-LAT catalog (1FGL). Although the diffuse Galactic and isotropic models used in the 2FGL analysis are improved compared to the 1FGL catalog, we attach caution flags to 162 of the sources to indicate possible confusion with residual imperfections in the diffuse model. The 2FGL catalog contains 1873 sources detected and characterized in the 100 MeV to 100 GeV range of which we consider 127 as being firmly identified and 1171 as being reliably associated with counterparts of known or likely γ-ray-producing source classes. We dedicate this paper to the memory of our colleague Patrick Nolan, who died on 2011 November 6. His career spanned much of the history of high-energy astronomy from space and his work on the Large Area Telescope (LAT) began nearly 20 years ago when it was just a concept. Pat was a central member in the operation of the LAT collaboration and he is greatly missed.},

We present nucleosynthesis results from relatively slow deflagration (1.5 - 3 % of the sound speed) to constrain the rate of accretion from the companion star. Because of electron capture, a significant amount of neutron-rich species such as 54Cr, 50Ti, 58Fe, 62Ni, etc. are synthesized in the central region. To avoid the too large ratios of 54Cr/(56Fe) and 50Ti/(56Fe), the central density of the white dwarf at thermonuclear runaway must be as low as <~ 2 × 109 g cm-3. Such a low central density can be realized by the accretion as fast as Ṁ >~ 1 × 10-7 Msolar yr-1. These rapidly accreting white dwarfs might correspond to the super-soft X-ray sources.},

In particular, we investigate the transport of the shocked dust within the SNR and its effect on the chemical composition, the size distribution, and the total mass of dust surviving in SNRs. We find that the evolution of the reverse shock, and hence its effect on the processing of the dust, depends on the thickness of the envelope retained by the progenitor star. Furthermore, the transport and survival of the dust grains depend on their initial radius, aini, and composition: for Type II SNRs expanding into the ISM with a density of nH,0=1 cm-3, small grains with aini<~0.05 μm are completely destroyed by sputtering in the postshock flow, while grains with aini=0.05-0.2 μm are trapped into the dense shell behind the forward shock. Very large grains of aini>~0.2 μm are ejected into the ISM without decreasing their sizes significantly. We find that the total mass fraction of dust that is destroyed by the reverse shock ranges from 0.2 to 1.0, depending on the energy of the explosion and the density of the ambient ISM. The results of our calculations have significant impact on the abundance pattern of the second-generation stars that form in the dense shell of primordial SNRs.},

Afterwards the PWN is compressed by the SNR, where the particles in the PWN are accelerated by the adiabatic compression. By using a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that particles accelerated by the SNR to 0.1 PeV can be reaccelerated to 1 PeV until the end of the PWN compression.},

Our model describes the expansion of an SNR through a magnetized interstellar medium, including the initial clumping of ejecta and the effects on shock dynamics due to back-reaction of accelerated CRs. The model predictions are compared to the observations of SN 1006. We found that the back-reaction of accelerated CRs alone cannot reproduce the observed separation between the forward shock and the contact discontinuity unless the energy losses through CR acceleration and escape are very large and independent of the obliquity angle. On the contrary, the clumping of ejecta can naturally reproduce the observed small separation and the occurrence of protrusions observed in SN 1006, even without the need of accelerated CRs. We conclude that forward shock-contact discontinuity separation is a probe of the ejecta structure at the time of explosion rather than a probe of the efficiency of CR acceleration in young SNRs.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore the importance of magnetic-field-oriented thermal conduction in the interaction of supernova remnant (SNR) shocks with radiative gas clouds and in determining the mass and energy exchange between the clouds and the hot surrounding medium. We perform 2.5-dimensional MHD simulations of a shock impacting on an isolated gas cloud, including anisotropic thermal conduction and radiative cooling; we consider the representative case of a Mach 50 shock impacting on a cloud 10 times denser than the ambient medium. We consider different configurations of the ambient magnetic field and compare MHD models with or without thermal conduction. The efficiency of thermal conduction in the presence of a magnetic field is, in general, reduced with respect to the unmagnetized case. The reduction factor strongly depends on the initial magnetic field orientation, and it is at a minimum when the magnetic field is initially aligned with the direction of the shock propagation. Thermal conduction contributes to the suppression of hydrodynamic instabilities, reducing the mass mixing of the cloud and preserving the cloud from complete fragmentation. Depending on the magnetic field orientation, the heat conduction may determine a significant energy exchange between the cloud and the hot surrounding medium which, while remaining always at levels less than those in the unmagnetized case, leads to a progressive heating and evaporation of the cloud. This additional heating may offset the radiative cooling of some parts of the cloud, preventing the onset of thermal instabilities.},

Methods: We perform 3D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1) through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2) through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission, making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of relativistic electrons. Results: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models and observations. Conclusions: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.},

Its observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory at days 16 and 17 have revealed a spectrum characterized by asymmetric and blueshifted emission lines. Here we investigate the origin of these asymmetries through 3D hydrodynamic simulations describing the outburst during the first 20 d of evolution. The model takes into account thermal conduction and radiative cooling, and assumes that a blast wave propagates through an equatorial density enhancement (EDE). From these simulations, we synthesize the X-ray emission and derive the spectra as they would be observed with Chandra. We find that both the blast wave and the ejecta distribution are efficiently collimated in polar directions due to the presence of the EDE. The majority of the X-ray emission originates from the interaction of the blast with the EDE and is concentrated on the equatorial plane as a ring-like structure. Our `best-fitting' model requires a mass of ejecta in the outburst Mej ≈ 3 × 10-7 M⊙ and an explosion energy Eb ≈ 3 × 1043 erg, and reproduces the distribution of emission measure versus temperature and the evolution of shock velocity and temperature inferred from the observations. The model predicts asymmetric and blueshifted line profiles similar to those observed and explains their origin as due to substantial X-ray absorption of redshifted emission by ejecta material. The comparison of predicted and observed Ne and O spectral line ratios reveals no signs of strong Ne enhancement and suggests that the progenitor is a CO white dwarf.},

  Abstract                 = {The remnants of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) have complex morphologies that may reflect asymmetries and structures developed during the progenitor SN explosion. Here we investigate how the morphology of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A) reflects the characteristics of the progenitor SN with the aim of deriving the energies and masses of the post-explosion anisotropies responsible for the observed spatial distribution of Fe and Si/S. We model the evolution of Cas A from the immediate aftermath of the progenitor SN to the three-dimensional interaction of the remnant with the surrounding medium. The post-explosion structure of the ejecta is described by small-scale clumping of material and larger-scale anisotropies. The hydrodynamic multi-species simulations consider an appropriate post-explosion isotopic composition of the ejecta. The observed average expansion rate and shock velocities can be well reproduced by models with ejecta mass M ej ≈ 4M ⊙ and explosion energy E SN ≈ 2.3 × 1051 erg. The post-explosion anisotropies (pistons) reproduce the observed distributions of Fe and Si/S if they had a total mass of ≈0.25 M ⊙ and a total kinetic energy of ≈1.5 × 1050 erg. The pistons produce a spatial inversion of ejecta layers at the epoch of Cas A, leading to the Si/S-rich ejecta physically interior to the Fe-rich ejecta. The pistons are also responsible for the development of the bright rings of Si/S-rich material which form at the intersection between the reverse shock and the material accumulated around the pistons during their propagation. Our result supports the idea that the bulk of asymmetries observed in Cas A are intrinsic to the explosion.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an analysis of X-ray observations of the Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) HB21 (G89.0+4.7) and CTB 1 (G116.9+0.2), two well-known members of the class of mixed-morphology (MM) SNRs. Our analysis draws upon observations of both SNRs made with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA): we have also used an archived Chandra observation of CTB 1 as part of this effort. We find a marked contrast between the X-ray properties of HB21 and CTB 1: in the case of HB21, the extracted spectra of the northwest and southeast regions of the X-ray-emitting plasma associated with the SNR can be fit with a single thermal model with marginally enhanced silicon and sulfur abundances. For both of these regions, the derived column density and temperature are N H ~ 0.3 × 1022 cm-2 and kT ~ 0.7 keV, respectively. No significant spatial differences in temperature or elemental abundances between the two regions are detected and the X-ray-emitting plasma for both regions is close to ionization equilibrium. Our Chandra spectral analysis of CTB 1 reveals that this source is likely an oxygen-rich SNR with enhanced abundances of oxygen and neon: this result is quite surprising for an evolved SNR like CTB 1. The high angular resolution Chandra observation of CTB 1 reveals spectral variations across this SNR: in particular, we have detected localized hard emission with an angular extent of ~1'. The extracted ASCA spectra for both the southwest and northeastern regions of CTB 1 cannot be fit with a single thermal component and instead an additional component is required to account for the presence of excess emission seen at higher energies. Based on our fits to the extracted ASCA spectra, we derive a column density N H ~ 0.6 × 1022 cm-2 and a temperature for the soft thermal component of kT soft ~ 0.28 keV for both regions. The hard emission from the southwest region may be modeled with either a thermal component with a temperature kT hard ~ 3 keV or by a power-law component with a photon index Γ ~ 2-3; for the northeast region, the hard emission may be modeled with a power-law component with a photon index Γ = 1.4. The detection of center-filled ejecta-dominated X-ray emission from HB21 and CTB 1 as well as other MM SNRs suggests a new scenario for the origin of the contrasting X-ray and radio morphologies of this class of sources. Lastly, we have analyzed the properties of the discrete hard X-ray source 1WGA J0001.4+6229 which is seen in projection just inside the northeastern shell of CTB 1. Our extracted ASCA GIS spectra of this source are best fit using a power-law model with a photon index Γ = 2.2+0.5 -1.2: this slope is typical for featureless power-law continua produced by rotation-powered pulsars. This source may be a neutron star associated with CTB 1. We find marginal evidence for X-ray pulsations from this source with a period of 47.6154 ms. A deep radio observation of this source failed to reveal any pulsations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present imaging and spectral studies of the supernova remnant (SNR) Sagittarius (Sgr) A East from deep observations with Chandra. The spatially resolved spectral analysis of Sgr A East reveals the presence of a two-temperature thermal plasma (kT~1 and 5 keV) near the center of the SNR. The central region is dominated by emission from highly ionized Fe-rich ejecta. We estimate a conservative upper limit to the total Fe ejecta mass of the SNR, MFe<0.27 Msolar. Comparisons with standard SN nucleosynthesis models suggest that this Fe mass limit is consistent with a Type II SN explosion for the origin of Sgr A East. On the other hand, the soft X-ray emission extending toward the north of the SNR can be described by a single-temperature (kT~1.3 keV) thermal plasma with normal chemical composition. This portion of the SNR is thus X-ray emission from the heated interstellar medium rather than the metal-rich stellar ejecta. We point out that a hard pointlike source CXOGC J174545.5-285829 (the so-called cannonball) at the northern edge of the SNR shows X-ray characteristics unusual among other Galactic center sources. The morphological, spectral, and temporal characteristics of this source suggest identification as a high-velocity neutron star. Based on the suggested Type II origin for the SNR Sgr A East and the proximity between the two, we propose that CXOGC J174545.5-285829 is a high-velocity neutron star candidate, born from the core-collapse SN that also created the SNR Sgr A East.},

The local linear theory of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is used as a predictor of the growth of magnetic field perturbations in the global simulations. The linear growth estimates and global simulations diverge when nonlinear motions—perhaps triggered by the onset of turbulence—upset the velocity perturbations used to excite the MRI. The saturated state is found to be independent of the initially excited MRI mode, showing that once the disk has expelled the initially net flux field and settled into quasi-periodic oscillations in the toroidal magnetic flux, the dynamo cycle regulates the global saturation stress level. Furthermore, time-averaged measures of converged turbulence, such as the ratio of magnetic energies, are found to be in agreement with previous works. In particular, the globally averaged stress normalized to the gas pressure \overline{< α_P> } = 0.034, with notably higher values achieved for simulations with higher azimuthal resolution. Supplementary tests are performed using different numerical algorithms and resolutions. Convergence with resolution during the initial linear MRI growth phase is found for 23-35 cells per scale height (in the vertical direction).},

  Abstract                 = {In many magnetized, dilute astrophysical plasmas, thermal conduction occurs almost exclusively parallel to magnetic field lines. In this case, the usual stability criterion for convective stability, the Schwarzschild criterion, which depends on entropy gradients, is modified. In the magnetized long mean free path regime, instability occurs for small wavenumbers when (∂ P/∂z) (∂ ln T/∂ z) > 0, which we refer to as the Balbus criterion. We refer to the convective-type instability that results as the magnetothermal instability (MTI). We use the equations of MHD with anisotropic electron heat conduction to numerically simulate the linear growth and nonlinear saturation of the MTI in plane-parallel atmospheres that are unstable according to the Balbus criterion. The linear growth rates measured from the simulations are in excellent agreement with the weak field dispersion relation. The addition of isotropic conduction, e.g. radiation, or strong magnetic fields can damp the growth of the MTI and affect the nonlinear regime. The instability saturates when the atmosphere becomes isothermal as the source of free energy is exhausted. By maintaining a fixed temperature difference between the top and bottom boundaries of the simulation domain, sustained convective turbulence can be driven. MTI-stable layers introduced by isotropic conduction are used to prevent the formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers. We find that the largest component of the time-averaged heat flux is due to advective motions as opposed to the actual thermal conduction itself. Finally, we explore the implications of this instability for a variety of astrophysical systems, such as neutron stars, the hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, and the structure of radiatively inefficient accretion flows.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a catalogue of dense molecular clumps located within the W51 giant molecular cloud (GMC). This work is based on Heterodyne Array Receiver Programme 13CO J = 3-2 observations of the W51 GMC and uses the automated CLUMPFIND algorithm to decompose the region into a total of 1575 clumps of which 1130 are associated with the W51 GMC. We clearly see the distinct structures of the W51 complex and the high-velocity stream previously reported. We find the clumps have characteristic diameters of 1.4 pc, excitation temperatures of 12 K, densities of 5.6 × 1021 cm-2, surface densities 0.02 g cm-2 and masses of 90 M⊙. We find a total mass of dense clumps within the GMC of 1.5 × 105 M⊙, with only 1 per cent of the clumps detected by number and 4 per cent by mass found to be supercritical. We find a clump-forming efficiency of 14 ± 1 per cent for the W51 GMC and a supercritical clump-forming efficiency of 0.5-0.5+2.3 per cent. Looking at the clump mass distribution, we find it is described by a single power law with a slope of α=2.4-0.1+0.2 above ˜100 M⊙. By comparing locations of supercritical clumps and young clusters, we see that any future star formation is likely to be located away from the currently active W51A region.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the updated empirical radio surface-brightness-to-diameter (Sigma - D) relation for supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy. Our original calibration sample of Galactic SNRs with independently determined distances (Pavlovic et al. 2013, hereafter Paper I) is reconsidered and updated with data which became available in the past two years. The orthogonal fitting procedure and probability-density-function-based (PDF) method are applied to the calibration sample in the log Sigma - log D plane. Non-standard orthogonal regression keeps the Sigma-D and D-Sigma relations invariant within estimated uncertainties. Our previous Monte Carlo simulations verified that the slopes of the empirical Sigma-D relation should be determined by using the orthogonal regression, because of its good performances for data sets with severe scatter. The updated calibration sample contains 65 shell SNRs. 6 new Galactic SNRs are added to the sample from Paper I, one is omitted and distances are changed for 10 SNRs. The slope derived is here slightly steeper (β ≈ 5.2) than the Sigma-D slope in Paper I (β ≈ 4.8). The PDF method relies on data points density maps which can provide more reliable calibrations that preserve more information contained in the calibration sample. We estimate distances to five new faint Galactic SNRs discovered for the first time by Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, and obtained distances of 2.3, 4.0, 1.3, 2.9 and 4.7 kiloparsecs for G108.5+11.0, G128.5+2.6, G149.5+3.2, G150.8+3.8 and G160.1-1.1, respectively. The updated empirical relation is used to estimate distances of 160 shell Galactic SNRs and new results change their distance scales up to 15 per cent, compared to the results from Paper I. The PDF calculation can provide even few times higher or lower values in comparison with the orthogonal fit, as it uses a totally different approach. However, on average, this difference is 32, 24 and 18 per cent for mode, median and mean distances.},

Since the FITS format definition document (the “standard”) was last printed in this journal in 2001, several new features have been developed and standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables, and new world coordinate system conventions which provide a mapping from an element in a data array to a physical coordinate on the sky or within a spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided here in its entirety. In addition to describing the new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were made to the previous version to clarify and reorganize many of the sections. Also included are some appendices which are not formally part of the standard. The FITS standard is likely to undergo further evolution, in which case the latest version may be found on the FITS Support Office Web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/">http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/</ext-link>, which also provides many links to FITS-related resources.},

The very-high-energy γ-ray maps arising from inverse Compton processes are also synthesized. The properties of images in these different wavelength bands are compared, with particular emphasis on the location of the bright limbs in bilateral SNRs. Recent High-Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) observations of SN 1006 show that the radio and inverse Compton γ-ray limbs coincide, and we found that this may happen if (i) injection is isotropic but the variation of the maximum energy of electrons is rather fast to compensate for differences in the magnetic field, or (ii) the obliquity dependence of injection (either quasi-parallel or quasi-perpendicular) and the electron maximum energy are strong enough to dominate the magnetic field variation. In the latter case, the obliquity dependences of the injection and the maximum energy should not be opposite. We argue that the position of the limbs alone, and even their coincidence in radio, X-rays and γ-rays, as discovered by HESS in SN 1006, cannot be conclusive as regards the dependence of the electron injection efficiency, the compression/amplification of the ISMF and the electron maximum energy on the obliquity angle.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of important processes taking place around strong shocks in supernova remnants (SNRs) depend on the shock obliquity. The measured synchrotron flux is a function of the aspect angle between interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) and the line of sight. Thus, a model of non-thermal emission from SNRs should account for the orientation of the ambient magnetic field. We develop a new method for the estimation of the aspect angle, based on the comparison between observed and synthesized radio maps of SNRs, making different assumptions about the dependence of electron injection efficiency on the shock obliquity. The method uses the azimuthal profile of radio surface brightness as a probe for orientation of ambient magnetic field because it is almost insensitive to the downstream distribution of magnetic field and emitting electrons. We apply our method to a new radio image of SN 1006 produced on the basis of archival Very Large Array and Parkes data. The image recovers emission from all spatial structures with angular scales from a few arcsec to 15arcmin. We explore different models of injection efficiency and find the following best-fitting values for the aspect angle of SN 1006: φo = 70o +/- 4.2o if the injection is isotropic, φo = 64o +/- 2.8o for quasi-perpendicular injection (SNR has an equatorial belt in both cases) and φo = 11o +/- 0.8o for quasi-parallel injection (polar-cap model of SNR). In the last case, SN 1006 is expected to have a centrally peaked morphology contrary to what is observed. Therefore, our analysis provides some indication against the quasi-parallel injection model.},

Additionally we present the deepest spectroscopic observation of the Galactic center (GC) so far, probing the number of B9/A0 main-sequence stars (2.2-2.8 M sun) in two deep fields. From spectrophotometry we construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the red giant population and fit the observed diagram with model populations to derive the star formation history of the nuclear cluster. We find (1) that the average nuclear star formation rate dropped from an initial maximum ~10 Gyr ago to a deep minimum 1-2 Gyr ago and increased again during the last few hundred Myrs, (2) that roughly 80% of the stellar mass formed more than 5 Gyr ago, and (3) that mass estimates within R ~ 1 pc from Sgr A* favor a dominant star formation mode with a "normal" Chabrier/Kroupa initial mass function for the majority of the past star formation in the GC. The bulk stellar mass seems to have formed under conditions significantly different from the young stellar disks, perhaps because at the time of the formation of the nuclear cluster the massive black hole and its sphere of influence were much smaller than today.

Additional masers were found in Sgr A East. More than 40 masers were found in G1.4-0.1, which we deduce are due to interactions between the SNR and at least two separate molecular clouds. The six masers in W28 are associated with the molecular cloud that is also associated with the OH maser excitation. We discuss the possibility that the methanol maser may be more numerous in SNRs than the OH maser, but harder to detect due to observational constraints.},

We search for infrared counterparts to SNRs in Green's catalog and identify 39 out of 121, i.e., a detection rate of about 32%. Such a relatively low detection fraction is mainly due to confusion with nearby foreground/background sources and diffuse emission. The SNRs in our sample show a linear trend in [F 8/F 24] versus [F 70/F 24]. We compare their infrared fluxes with their corresponding radio flux at 1.4 GHz and find that most remnants have a ratio of 70 μm to 1.4 GHz which is similar to those found in previous studies of SNRs (with the exception of a few that have ratios closer to those of H II regions). Furthermore, we retrieve a slope close to unity when correlating infrared (24 and 70 μm) with 1.4 GHz emission. Our survey is more successful in detecting remnants with bright X-ray emission, which we find is well correlated with the 24 μm morphology. Moreover, by comparing the power emitted in the X-ray, infrared, and radio, we conclude that the energy released in the infrared is comparable to the cooling in the X-ray range.},

  Abstract                 = {We present X-ray observations of two young energetic radio pulsars, PSRs B1046-58 and B1610-50, and their surroundings, using archival data from the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA). The energetic pulsar PSR B1610-50 is detected in X-rays with a significance of 4.5 σ. The unabsorbed flux, estimated assuming a power-law spectrum and a neutral hydrogen column density NH of 5×1021 cm-2, is (2.5+/-0.3)×10-13 ergs cm-2 s-1 in the 2-10 keV band. Pulsed emission is not detected; the pulsed fraction is less than 31% at the 90% confidence level for a 50% duty cycle. We argue that the emission is best explained as originating from a pulsar-powered synchrotron nebula. The X-ray counterpart of the pulsar is the only hard source within the 95% error region of the previously unidentified γ-ray source 3EG J1048-5840. This evidence supports the results of Kaspi et al., who suggest, in a companion paper, that PSR B1046-58 is the counterpart to 3EG J1048-5840. X-ray emission from PSR B1610-50 is not detected. Using assumptions similar to those above, the derived 3 σ upper limit for the unabsorbed 2-10 keV X-ray flux is 1.5×10-13 ergs cm-2 s-1. We use the flux limit to estimate the pulsar's velocity to be less than ~170 km s-1, casting doubt on a previously reported association between PSR B1610-50 and supernova remnant Kes 32. Kes 32 is detected, as is evident from the correlation between X-ray and radio emission. The ASCA images of PSR B1610-50 are dominated by mirror-scattered emission from the X-ray-bright supernova remnant RCW 103, located 33' away. We find no evidence for extended emission around either pulsar, in contrast to previous reports of large nebulae surrounding both pulsars.},

This compendium presents broad-band X-ray continuum maps, soft X-ray intensity maps, a decomposition into spectral components and a comparison of the X-ray maps with emission at other wavelengths. Newly discovered extended features, such as supernova remnants (SNRs), superbubbles and X-ray filaments are reported. We provide an atlas of extended features within ±1° of Sgr A⋆. We discover the presence of a coherent X-ray-emitting region peaking around G0.1-0.1 and surrounded by the ring of cold, mid-IR-emitting material known from previous work as the `Radio Arc Bubble' and with the addition of the X-ray data now appears to be a candidate superbubble. Sgr A's bipolar lobes show sharp edges, suggesting that they could be the remnant, collimated by the circumnuclear disc, of an SN explosion that created the recently discovered magnetar, SGR J1745-2900. Soft X-ray features, most probably from SNRs, are observed to fill holes in the dust distribution, and to indicate a direct interaction between SN explosions and Galactic centre (GC) molecular clouds. We also discover warm plasma at high Galactic latitude, showing a sharp edge to its distribution that correlates with the location of known radio/mid-IR features such as the `GC Lobe'. These features might be associated with an inhomogeneous hot `atmosphere' over the GC, perhaps fed by continuous or episodic outflows of mass and energy from the GC region.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent TeV observations of nearby pulsars with the HAWC telescope have been interpreted as evidence that the diffusion of high-energy electrons and positrons within pulsar wind nebulae is highly inefficient compared to the rest of the interstellar medium. If the diffusion coefficient well outside the nebula is close to the value inferred for the region inside the nebula, high-energy electrons and positrons produced by the two observed pulsars could not contribute significantly to the local measured cosmic-ray flux. The HAWC Collaboration thus concluded that, under the assumption of isotropic and homogeneous diffusion, the two pulsars are ruled out as sources of the anomalous high-energy positron flux. Here, we argue that since the diffusion coefficient is likely not spatially homogeneous, the assumption leading to this conclusion is flawed. We solve the diffusion equation with a radially dependent diffusion coefficient, and show that the pulsars observed by HAWC produce potentially perfect matches to the observed high-energy positron fluxes. We also study the implications of inefficient diffusion within pulsar wind nebulae on Galactic scales, and show that cosmic rays are likely to have very long residence times in regions of inefficient diffusion. We describe how this prediction can be tested with studies of the diffuse Galactic emission.},

Eighteen infrared counterparts were detected. Many other supernova remnants could have significant infrared emission but are in portions of the Milky Way too confused to allow the separation of bright H II regions and pervasive mid-infrared emission from atomic and molecular clouds along the line of sight. Infrared emission from supernova remnants originates from synchrotron emission, shock-heated dust, atomic fine-structure lines, and molecular lines. The detected remnants are G11.2-0.3, Kes 69, G22.7-0.2, 3C 391, W44, 3C 396, 3C 397, W49B, G54.4-0.3, Kes 17, Kes 20A, RCW 103, G344.7-0.1, G346.6-0.2, CTB 37A, G348.5-0.0, and G349.7+0.2. The infrared colors suggest emission from molecular lines (nine remnants), fine-structure lines (three remnants), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (four remnants), or a combination; some remnants feature multiple colors in different regions. None of the remnants are dominated by synchrotron radiation at mid-infrared wavelengths. The IRAC-detected sample emphasizes remnants interacting with relatively dense gas, for which most of the shock cooling occurs through molecular or ionic lines in the mid-infrared.},

Therefore, particles accelerated in supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae encounter optimal conditions for interacting with target material and photon fields, and thus produce gamma-ray emission. However, observations are challenging because multiple phenomena may appear entangled within the resolution of current gamma-ray telescopes. We report on MAGIC observations aimed to understand the nature of the emission from the star-forming region W51 and the unidentified source HESS J1857+026. While gamma-ray emission from W51 is dominated by the interaction of the supernova remnant W51C with dense molecular clouds, HESS J1857+026 is associated to the pulsar wind nebula from PSR J1856+0245. However, an additional source is resolved north of HESSJ1857+026, with sufficient separation to determine that it cannot be powered by the same pulsar. We search for multiwavelength data to determine the origin of the new source.},

  Abstract                 = {Over 100 trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for masers associated with young, high-mass stars have been measured with the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy Survey, a Very Long Baseline Array key science project, the European VLBI Network, and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry project. These measurements provide strong evidence for the existence of spiral arms in the Milky Way, accurately locating many arm segments and yielding spiral pitch angles ranging from about 7° to 20°. The widths of spiral arms increase with distance from the Galactic center. Fitting axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the three-dimensional position and velocity information and conservative priors for the solar and average source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center, R 0, to be 8.34 ± 0.16 kpc, a circular rotation speed at the Sun, Θ0, to be 240 ± 8 km s-1, and a rotation curve that is nearly flat (i.e., a slope of -0.2 ± 0.4 km s-1 kpc-1) between Galactocentric radii of ≈5 and 16 kpc. Assuming a "universal" spiral galaxy form for the rotation curve, we estimate the thin disk scale length to be 2.44 ± 0.16 kpc. With this large data set, the parameters R 0 and Θ0 are no longer highly correlated and are relatively insensitive to different forms of the rotation curve. If one adopts a theoretically motivated prior that high-mass star forming regions are in nearly circular Galactic orbits, we estimate a global solar motion component in the direction of Galactic rotation, V ⊙ = 14.6 ± 5.0 km s-1. While Θ0 and V ⊙ are significantly correlated, the sum of these parameters is well constrained, Θ0 + V ⊙ = 255.2 ± 5.1 km s-1, as is the angular speed of the Sun in its orbit about the Galactic center, (Θ0 + V ⊙)/R 0 = 30.57 ± 0.43 km s-1 kpc-1. These parameters improve the accuracy of estimates of the accelerations of the Sun and the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in their Galactic orbits, significantly reducing the uncertainty in tests of gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity.},

  Abstract                 = {The Sun is located inside an extremely low density region called the Local Bubble (LB). Although they have been studied through a large variety of techniques, the contours of its neutral boundary, defined by a dense wall of interstellar gas and dust, are still an open issue. Our aim is to determine the interstellar reddening in the LB region by means of Strömgren photometry, validating the conclusions through a comparison with high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical models of the Local and Loop I bubbles' formation and evolution. We have obtained color excesses and distances using the uvbyHβ data of the General Catalogue of Photometric Data, complemented by 820 stars from more recent catalogs, for midbmid <= 60°. A set of restrictive exclusion criteria has been applied to eliminate E(b - y) values inappropriate for the study of the interstellar medium (ISM). The final sample has 8492 stars located up to 500 pc from the Sun. Our main results are as follows: (1) the large-scale distribution of the interstellar dust in the LB is highly inhomogeneous; (2) on the Galactic plane, E(b - y) >= 0fm040 is observed at a distance of d ≈ 80-100 pc from l >= 270° until l <= 45° (3) the color excess suggests that there are many tunnels and holes in the LB wall; and (4) there is a clear correlation between E(b - y) and the spatial density distribution of the interstellar gas inferred from the simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Many shell supernova remnants are now known to radiate synchrotron X-rays. Several objects have also been detected in TeV gamma rays. Nonthermal X-rays and gamma rays can be produced in shell remnants by extremely energetic ions and electrons due to decay of π0 mesons produced in inelastic collisions between ions and thermal gas, or by electron synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, or inverse-Compton radiation. Thus observations at X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths constrain the process of particle acceleration to high energies in the shock waves of supernova remnants. This review examines the relevant characteristics of Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae, the dynamics of their evolution through the Sedov blast-wave phase, the basic physics of diffusive shock acceleration, and the physics of the relevant radiative processes. It also reviews the current status of observations of shell remnants from X-rays to TeV gamma rays, and summarizes what we can learn about particle acceleration.},

In the test-particle limit of diffusive shock acceleration, in which the energy in shock-accelerated particles is unimportant, the slope of a shock-accelerated power-law is independent of the diffusion coefficient κ and on how κ depends on particle energy. However, the maximum energy to which particles can be accelerated depends on the rate of acceleration and that does depend on the energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient. If the time to accelerate an electron from thermal energies to energy E>mec2 is τ(E) and if κ~Eβ, then τ(E)~Eβ in parallel shocks and τ~E2-β in perpendicular shocks. Most work on shock acceleration has made the plausible assumption that κ~rg (where rg is the particle gyroradius), so that β=1 at relativistic energies, implying a particular (wavelength-independent) spectrum of MHD turbulence, where Kolmogorov or Kraichnan spectra might be more physically plausible. I derive the β dependence of the maximum electron energy resulting from limitations due to radiative (synchrotron and inverse-Compton) losses and to finite remnant age (or size). I then exhibit calculations of synchrotron X-ray spectra, and model images, for supernova remnants as a function of β and compare to earlier β=1 results. Spectra can be considerably altered for β<1 and images are dramatically different for values of β corresponding to Kolmogorov or Kraichnan spectra of turbulence. The predicted images are quite unlike observed remnants, suggesting that the turbulence near SNRs is generated by the high-energy particles themselves.},

  Abstract                 = {The diffusive shock acceleration process can accelerate particles to a maximum energy depending on the shock speed and age and on any competing loss processes on the particles. The shock waves of young supernova remnants can easily accelerate electrons to energies in excess of 1 TeV, where they can produce X-rays by the synchrotron process. I describe a detailed calculation of the morphology and spectrum of synchrotron X-rays from supernova remnants. Remnants are assumed to be spherical and in the Sedov evolutionary phase, though the results are insensitive to the detailed dynamics. The upstream magnetic field is assumed uniform; downstream it is assumed to be compressed but not additionally turbulently amplified. In all cases, spectra begin to depart from power laws somewhere in the optical to UV range and roll off smoothly through the X-ray band. I show that simple approximations for the electron emissivity are not adequate; a full convolution of the individual electron synchrotron emissivity with a calculated electron distribution at each point in the remnant is required. Models limited by the finite shock age, by synchrotron or inverse Compton losses on electrons, or by escape of electrons above some energy have characteristically different spectral shapes, but within each class, models resemble one another strongly and can be related by simple scalings. The images and spectra depend primarily on the remnant age, the upstream magnetic field strength, and the level of magnetic turbulence near the shock in which the electrons scatter. In addition, images depend on the viewing or aspect angle between the upstream magnetic field and the line of sight. The diffusion coefficient is assumed to be proportional to particle energy (or mean free path proportional to gyroradius), but I investigate the possibility that the proportionality constant becomes much larger above some energy, corresponding to an absence of long-wavelength MHD waves. Models producing similar spectra may differ significantly in morphology, which allows for possible discriminations. I parameterize the model spectra in terms of a slope at 4 keV and a factor by which the X-ray flux density at that energy falls below the extrapolated radio spectrum. Synchrotron radiation may contribute significantly to the X-ray emission of remnants up to several thousand years old.},

The bright rims have a featureless power-law spectrum while fainter parts of the remnant show a normal thermal spectrum with the expected lines. I describe model images and spectra that fit the data from the bright rims well, on the premise that the X-rays are synchrotron emission from electrons with energies up to 100 TeV accelerated in the remnant blast wave. The maximum energy to which electrons can be accelerated is limited by the requirement that the acceleration time be less than the smaller of the remnant age or the electrons' radiative loss time. In addition, absence of magnetohydrodynamic waves with sufficiently long wavelength to scatter electrons above some energy would allow electrons to escape freely above that energy, rather than being further accelerated. The maximum energy is thus a function of time and position. I assume that the electron mean free path is proportional to gyroradius, with proportionality constant f. With no internal magnetic field amplification beyond the original shock compression, the observed morphology, spectral shape, and X-ray flux at 4 keV can be fitted well with two models, one with escape, and the other with a perhaps unreasonably low upstream magnetic field. The former model has an external magnetic field strength of 3 mu G, f = 10, and a maximum MHD wavelength of 1017 cm. The latter, no-escape model has an external magnetic field strength of 0.6 mu G and f = 1. Both models predict upstream emission at a level of a few percent of postshock emission, but with differing morphologies. Models with an upstream magnetic field of 3 mu G and without escape overpredict X-rays at 4 keV by over an order of magnitude.},

The radio morphology is also shell-like, but only about 84'' in diameter, based on observations made in 1985. We attribute the size difference to expansion between 1985 and our Chandra observations of 2007. Expansion is confirmed in comparing radio images from 1985 and 2008. We deduce that G1.9+0.3 is of order 100 years old—the youngest supernova remnant in the Galaxy. Based on a very high absorbing column density of 5.5 × 1022 cm-2, we place G1.9+0.3 near the Galactic center, at a distance of about 8.5 kpc, where the mean remnant radius would be about 2 pc, and the required expansion speed about 14,000 km s-1. The X-ray spectrum is featureless and well described by the exponentially cut off synchrotron model srcut. With the radio flux at 1 GHz fixed at 0.9 Jy, we find a spectral index of 0.65 and a rolloff frequency of 1.4 × 1018 Hz. The implied characteristic rolloff electron energy of about 94(B/10 μ G)-1/2 TeV is the highest ever reported for a shell supernova remnant. It can easily be reached by standard diffusive shock acceleration, given the very high shock velocities; it can be well described by either age-limited or synchrotron-loss-limited acceleration. Not only is G1.9+0.3 the youngest known Galactic remnant, it is also only the fourth Galactic X-ray-synchrotron-dominated shell supernova remnant.},

The integrated spectrum of the remnant shell obtained from our 30 ks exploratory Chandra observation shows very strong lines that require elevated element abundances from ejecta, in particular of sulfur. A plane-shock model fit gives a temperature kT=0.9 (0.8, 1.0) keV, an ionization timescale net=6 (4, 9)×1010 cm-3 s, and a sulfur abundance of 2.1 (1.7, 2.7) times solar (90% confidence limits). Two-component models with one solar and one enriched component are also plausible, but they are not well constrained by the data. Various estimates give a remnant age of order 103 yr, which would make G15.9+0.2 among the dozen or so youngest remnants in the Galaxy. The sparse point-source spectrum is consistent with either a steep Γ~4 power law or a kT~0.4 keV blackbody. The spectrum is absorbed by a H column density NH~4×1022 cm-2 similar to that required for the remnant shell. The implied 2-9.5 keV source luminosity is about 1033 ergs s-1 for an assumed distance of 8.5 kpc consistent with the high absorption column.

We have analyzed spectra of over 100 small regions, and find that they fall into three classes. (1) The vast majority show Fe L emission between 0.7 and 1 keV and Si and S Kα emission; we associate these with shocked ejecta. A few of these are found at or beyond the mean blast wave radius. (2) A very few regions show solar O/Fe abundance ratios; these we associate with shocked circumstellar medium (CSM). Otherwise O is scarce. (3) A few regions are dominated by continuum, probably synchrotron radiation. Finally, we find no central point source, with a limit ~100 times fainter than the central object in Cas A.

We have compared the resulting synchrotron profiles with observations of Tycho's remnant and find the amplified magnetic field model gives an adequate fit if there is a small radially ordered component of the magnetic field at the shock wave. The model predicts that surface brightness of Tycho declines as (diameter)-4.4 and that the flux declines by 0.25% per year. We explain the featureless power-law X-ray spectrum of the SN 1006 remnant as the extension of the radio emission: The entire spectrum can be fitted when synchrotron losses are included.

  abstract = {Young supernova remnants (SNRs) are often assumed to be the source of cosmic rays up to energies approaching the slight steepening in the cosmic-ray spectrum at around 1000 TeV, known as the ``knee.'' We show that the observed X-ray emission of 14 radio-bright shell remnants, including all five historical shells, can be used to put limits on Emax, the energy at which the electron energy distribution must steepen from its slope at radio-emitting energies. Most of the remnants show thermal spectra, so any synchrotron component must fall below the observed X-ray fluxes. We obtain upper limits on Emax by considering the most rapid physically plausible cutoff in the relativistic electron distribution, an exponential, which is as sharp or sharper than found in any more elaborate models. This maximally curved model then gives us the highest possible Emax consistent with not exceeding observed X-rays. Our results are thus independent of particular models for the electron spectrum in SNRs. Assuming homogeneous emitting volumes with a constant magnetic field strength of 10 μG, no object could reach 1000 TeV, and only one, Kes 73, has an upper limit on Emax above 100 TeV. All the other remnants have limits at or below 80 TeV. Emax is probably set by the finite remnant lifetime rather than by synchrotron losses for remnants younger than a few thousand years, so that an observed electron steepening should be accompanied by steepening at the same energy for protons. More complicated, inhomogeneous models could allow higher values of Emax in parts of the remnant, but the emission-weighted average value, that characteristic of typical electrons, should obey these limits. The young remnants are not expected to improve much over their remaining lives at producing the highest energy Galactic cosmic rays; if they cannot, this picture of cosmic-ray origin may need major alteration.},

The distance to this historical supernova remnant (SNR diameter~3') has been controversial, with estimates ranging from a few kiloparsecs to 12 kpc. Based on a weak H I absorption feature at +21.3 km s^-1 seen in the new data, a lower limit of 4.8+/-1.4 kpc can be derived. No prominent interstellar H I features are detected near Kepler's SNR, indicating that the evolution of the remnant has been influenced by the circumstellar medium, while the interstellar medium seems to have had negligible effect on the expansion process. At a velocity of +21.3 km s^-1, emission from an H I cloud to the east of the SNR is detected, which may be physically associated with the remnant of SN 1604, based on morphological considerations. An upper limit of 6.4 kpc to the distance can be derived based on the lack of H I absorption at a velocity of +50 km s^-1, where extended H I emission is detected.},

  Abstract                 = {Radio polarization observations provide essential information on the degree of order and orientation of magnetic fields, which themselves play a key role in the particle acceleration processes that take place in supernova remnants (SNRs). Here we present a radio polarization study of SN 1006, based on combined Very Large Array and Australia Telescope Compact Array observations at 20 cm that resulted in sensitive images with an angular resolution of 10 arcsec. The fractional polarization in the two bright radio and X-ray lobes of the SNR is measured to be 0.17, while in the southeastern sector, where the radio and non-thermal X-ray emission are much weaker, the polarization fraction reaches a value of 0.6 ± 0.2, close to the theoretical limit of 0.7. We interpret this result as evidence of a disordered, turbulent magnetic field in the lobes, where particle acceleration is believed to be efficient, and a highly ordered field in the southeast, where the acceleration efficiency has been shown to be very low. Utilizing the frequency coverage of our observations, an average rotation measure of ~12 rad m-2 is determined from the combined data set, which is then used to obtain the intrinsic direction of the magnetic field vectors. While the orientation of magnetic field vectors across the SNR shell appear to be radial, a large fraction of the magnetic vectors lie parallel to the Galactic plane. Along the highly polarized southeastern rim, the field is aligned tangent to the shock, and therefore also nearly parallel to the Galactic plane. These results strongly suggest that the ambient field surrounding SN 1006 is aligned with this direction (i.e., from northeast to southwest) and that the bright lobes are due to a polar cap geometry. Our study establishes that the most efficient particle acceleration and generation of magnetic turbulence in SN 1006 is attained for shocks in which the magnetic field direction and shock normal are quasi-parallel, while inefficient acceleration and little to no generation of magnetic turbulence are obtained for the quasi-perpendicular case.},

These observations have revealed a number of molecular clouds interacting with the SNR shock fronts. Most of the OH 1720 MHz masers have been found to lie over CO concentrations, and the maser velocities are coincident with the CO peak velocities to an accuracy better than 2 km s-1. The present data trace the interstellar medium (ISM) structures interacting with the SNRs; however, to probe the shocked molecular gas in which the OH 1720 MHz emission originates, higher excitation transitions and more complex species should be observed. In CTB 37A, where the shock velocity into the molecular cloud could be determined, it has been found to be of C-type, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Part of the rim of G16.7+0.1 appears to be flattened by a dense external cloud, yet the only associated OH 1720 MHz maser lies near the opposite region of the remnant. This behavior, also observed in IC 443 and 3C 391, seems to contradict the suggestion that OH 1720 MHz maser emission occurs mainly for transverse shocks.},

  Abstract                 = {While shell-like, Crab-like, and composite supernova remnants (SNRs) represent well-defined classes, there is another group of SNRs with different X-ray and radio morphologies: shell-like in the radio and centrally filled in the X-ray (with little or no limb brightening). We present the results of a systematic X-ray study of 19 such remnants, using ROSAT and ASCA data. We show that they have physical and environmental properties distinct from the other categories, and we propose that they form a unique class that we term ``mixed-morphology'' supernova remnants. We found two prominent distinctions of this new class: their dominant X-ray emission mechanism is thermal despite their X-ray morphological similarity to Crab-like SNRs, and their emission arises primarily from swept-up interstellar material, not ejecta. The temperature across each remnant is nearly uniform, and the density and pressure are constant or increase toward the remnant center, contrary to the standard Sedov model. Most of these remnants are interacting with molecular or H I clouds, as indicated in some cases by strong infrared line emission or OH masers. The population represents at least 8% of all Galactic SNRs and as much as 25% of all X-ray-detected Galactic SNRs. This suggests that supernovae often explode in an environment that is conducive to the formation of a mixed-morphology remnant. The two most likely mechanisms for forming these remnants--evaporation of many small interior clouds and interior ``fossil radiation'' evolved in a denser than normal medium--require a reservoir of material with density higher than the typical intercloud ISM.},

We show that the morphology and X-ray intensity of this feature match very well with recently obtained Chandra images, and we infer a supernova remnant age of less than 2000 yr. This young age-a factor of 3-4 lower than previous estimates-arises from our inclusion of stellar wind effects in the initial (preexplosion) conditions in the medium. The supernova does not clear out the central ~0.2 pc region around Sgr A* and does not significantly alter the gas profile around the central black hole upon passage through the Galactic center.},

The results suggest that when compared to the main body of the remnant, the jet experienced less outward acceleration from the central pulsar's rapidly expanding synchrotron nebula. The jet's apparent expansion rate yields an undecelerated explosion date for the Crab Nebula of 1055 +/- 24 CE, a date much closer to the appearance of the historic 1054 CE guest star than the 1120-1140 CE dates estimated in previous studies using filaments located within the remnant's main nebula. Our proper motion measurements suggest the jet likely formed during the 1054 supernova explosion and represents the remnant's highest velocity knots possibly associated with a suspected N-S bipolar outflow from the supernova explosion.},

  Abstract                 = {As part of a systematic search programme of a 10° wide strip of the northern Galactic plane, we present preliminary evidence for the discovery of four (and possibly five) new supernova remnants (SNRs). The pilot search area covered the 19-20 h right ascension zone sampling from +20° to +55° in declination using binned mosaic images from the Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric Hα Survey (IPHAS). The optical identification of the candidate SNRs was based mainly on their filamentary and arc-like emission morphologies, their apparently coherent, even if fractured, structure and clear disconnection from any diffuse neighbouring H II region type nebulosity. Follow-up optical spectroscopy was undertaken, sampling carefully across prominent features of these faint sources. The resulting spectra revealed typical emission-line ratios for shock-excited nebulae which are characteristic of SNRs, which, along with the latest diagnostic diagrams, strongly support the likely SNR nature of these sources: G038.7-1.3 (IPHASX J190640.5+042819), G067.6+0.9 (IPHASX J195744.9+305306), G066.0-0.0 (IPHASX J195749.2+290259) and G065.8-0.5 (IPHASX J195920.4+283740). A fifth possible younger, higher density nebula SNR candidate, G067.8+0.5 (IPHASX J200002.4+305035), was discovered ˜5 arcmin to the west of IPHASX J195744.9+305306, and it warrants further study. A multiwavelength cross-check from available archived data in the regions of these candidates was also performed with a focus on possible radio counterparts. A close positional match between previously unrecognized radio structures at several frequencies and across various components of the Hα optical image data was found for all SNR candidates. This lends further direct support for the SNR nature of these objects. Evolved SNRs may have very weak and/or highly fragmented radio emission which could explain why they had not been previously recognized, but the association becomes clear in combination with the optical emission.},

  Abstract                 = {Narrowband images of the Crab Nebula taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 show the morphology and ionization structure of the filaments in great detail. At HST resolution, low- and high-ionization emission from filaments in the Crab differ in two complementary respects. First, low-ionization emission is found to be concentrated in very sharp structures, while high-ionization emission is predominantly found in a much more diffuse component. For example, approximately 80% of emission from [O I] λ6300 arises in features with scales of less than 0.5", while only 10% of [O III] λ5007 emission arises in such compact structures. Second, individual filaments are found to lie along a sequence of ionization structures, ranging from features in which all lines are concentrated in the same compact volume through features with low-ionization cores surrounded by high-ionization envelopes. Hester and coworkers proposed in 1996 that this sequence can be understood as the result of the nonlinear development of magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instabilities along the interface between the Crab synchrotron nebula and swept-up ejecta. We present photoionization models of cylindrically symmetrical filaments consisting of a quadratic core surrounded by an extended envelope. A good deal of the observed variation in filament structure in the Crab can be matched by varying the assumed density profiles in these models. This implies that variations in the development of R-T instabilities in the Crab account for much of the spectral variation within the remnant. We also present a photoionization model of a uniform, low-density medium, which reasonably matches the extended diffuse component that dominates the high-ionization emission. This envelope model produces strong [O III] but virtually no [O I]. While the He I/Hβ ratio remains fairly constant throughout a range of filament models, this ratio is a factor of 5 lower in the envelope model. We find that the apertures used in ground-based spectroscopy of the Crab generally include emission from several discrete filaments as well as a component of diffuse emission. This places a fundamental limit on what can be inferred reliably from comparison of spectra with one-dimensional photoionization models. Many filament cores coincide with dust extinction features seen in a continuum image of the Crab. We consider one such feature in detail and find that the extinction of about 1.2 mag suggests that the dust-to-gas mass ratio may be an order of magnitude higher than is typical in the interstellar medium.

  Abstract                 = {Context. The supernova remnant (SNR) W51C is a Galactic object located in a strongly inhomogeneous interstellar medium with signs of an interaction of the SNR blast wave with dense molecular gas. Aims: Diffuse X-ray emission from the interior of the SNR can reveal element abundances in the different emission regions and shed light on the type of supernova (SN) explosion and its progenitor. The hard X-ray emission helps to identify possible candidates for a pulsar formed in the SN explosion and for its pulsar wind nebula (PWN). Methods: We have analysed X-ray data obtained with XMM-Newton. Spectral analyses in selected regions were performed. Results: Ejecta emission in the bright western part of the SNR, located next to a complex of dense molecular gas, was confirmed. The Ne and Mg abundances suggest a massive progenitor with a mass of >20 M⊙. Two extended regions emitting hard X-rays were identified (corresponding to the known sources [KLS2002] HX3 west and CXO J192318.5+140305 discovered with ASCA and Chandra, respectively), each of which has an additional point source inside and shows a power-law spectrum with Γ ≈ 1.8. Based on their X-ray emission, both sources can be classified as PWN candidates.

W51 Main/South is a well-known massive star-forming region near the tangent point of the Sagittarius spiral arm of the Milky Way. Our distance to W51 yields an estimate of the distance to the Galactic center of R 0 = 8.3 ± 0.46 (statistical) ±1.0 (systematic) kpc by simple geometry. Combining the parallax and proper motion measurements for W51, we obtained the full-space motion of this massive star-forming region. We find W51 is in a nearly circular orbit about the Galactic center. The H2O masers used for our parallax measurements trace four powerful bipolar outflows within a 0.4 pc size region, some of which are associated with dusty molecular hot cores and/or hyper- or ultra-compact H II regions.},

  Abstract                 = {A type Ia supernova is thought to begin with the explosion of a white dwarf star. The explosion could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs (a `double-degenerate' origin), or by mass transfer from a companion star (the `single-degenerate' path). The identity of the progenitor is still controversial; for example, a recent argument against the single-degenerate origin has been widely rejected. One way to distinguish between the double- and single-degenerate progenitors is to look at the centre of a known type Ia supernova remnant to see whether any former companion star is present. A likely ex-companion star for the progenitor of the supernova observed by Tycho Brahe has been identified, but that claim is still controversial. Here we report that the central region of the supernova remnant SNR 0509-67.5 (the site of a type Ia supernova 400 +/- 50 years ago, based on its light echo) in the Large Magellanic Cloud contains no ex-companion star to a visual magnitude limit of 26.9 (an absolute magnitude of MV = +8.4) within a region of radius 1.43 arcseconds. (This corresponds to the 3σ maximum distance to which a companion could have been `kicked' by the explosion.) This lack of any ex-companion star to deep limits rules out all published single-degenerate models for this supernova. The only remaining possibility is that the progenitor of this particular type Ia supernova was a double-degenerate system.},

  Abstract                 = {Precise measurements of the radio emission by cosmic ray air showers require an adequate treatment of noise. Unlike to usual experiments in particle physics, where noise always adds to the signal, radio noise can in principle decrease or increase the signal if it interferes by chance destructively or constructively. Consequently, noise cannot simply be subtracted from the signal, and its influence on amplitude and time measurement of radio pulses must be studied with care. First, noise has to be determined consistently with the definition of the radio signal which typically is the maximum field strength of the radio pulse. Second, the average impact of noise on radio pulse measurements at individual antennas is studied for LOPES. It is shown that a correct treatment of noise is especially important at low signal-to-noise ratios: noise can be the dominant source of uncertainty for pulse height and time measurements, and it can systematically flatten the slope of lateral distributions. The presented method can also be transferred to other experiments in radio and acoustic detection of cosmic rays and neutrinos.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. The origin and life-cycle of molecular clouds are still poorly constrained, despite their importance for understanding the evolution of the interstellar medium. Many large-scale surveys of the Galactic plane have been conducted recently, allowing for rapid progress in this field. Nevertheless, a sub-arcminute resolution global view of the large-scale distribution of molecular gas, from the diffuse medium to dense clouds and clumps, and of their relationshipto the spiral structure, is still missing. Aims: We have carried out a systematic, homogeneous, spectroscopic survey of the inner Galactic plane, in order to complement the many continuum Galactic surveys available with crucial distance and gas-kinematic information. Our aim is to combine this data set with recent infrared to sub-millimetre surveys at similar angular resolutions. Methods: The SEDIGISM survey covers 78 deg2 of the inner Galaxy (-60°≤ℓ≤ 18°, |b|≤ 0.5°) in the J = 2-1 rotational transition of 13CO. This isotopologue of CO is less abundant than 12CO by factors up to 100. Therefore, its emission has low to moderate optical depths, and higher critical density, making it an ideal tracer of the cold, dense interstellar medium. The data have been observed with the SHFI single-pixel instrument at APEX. The observational setup covers the 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1) lines, plus several transitions from other molecules. Results: The observations have been completed. Data reduction is in progress, and the final data products will be made available in the near future. Here we give a detailed description of the survey and the dedicated data reduction pipeline. To illustrate the scientific potential of this survey, preliminary results based on a science demonstration field covering -20°≤ℓ ≤ -18.5° are presented. Analysis of the 13CO(2-1) data in this field reveals compact clumps, diffuse clouds, and filamentary structures at a range of heliocentric distances. By combining our data with data in the (1-0) transition of CO isotopologues from the ThrUMMS survey, we are able to compute a 3D realization of the excitation temperature and optical depth in the interstellar medium. Ultimately, this survey will provide a detailed, global view of the inner Galactic interstellar medium at an unprecedented angular resolution of 30''.

  Abstract                 = {Two Chandra observations have been used to search for thermal X-ray emission from within and around the Crab Nebula. Dead time was minimized by excluding the brightest part of the nebula from the field of view. A dust-scattered halo comprising 5% of the strength of the Crab is clearly detected, with surface brightness measured out to a radial distance of 18'. Coverage is 100% at 4', 50% at 12', and 25% at 18'. The observed halo is compared with predictions based on three different interstellar grain models, and one can be adjusted to fit the observation. This dust halo and mirror scattering form a high background region that has been searched for emission from shock-heated material in an outer shell. We find no evidence for such emission. We can set upper limits a factor of 10-1000 less than the surface brightness observed from outer shells around similar remnants. The upper limit for X-ray luminosity of an outer shell is ~1034 ergs s-1. Although it is possible to reconcile our observation with an 8-13 Msolar progenitor, we argue that this is unlikely.},

There is structure in all directions. Fingers, loops, bays, and the south pulsar jet all indicate that either filamentary material or the magnetic field is controlling the relativistic electrons. In general, spectra soften as distance from the pulsar increases but do not change rapidly along linear features. This is particularly true for the pulsar jet. The termination of the jet is abrupt; the east side is close to an [O III] optical filament, which may be blocking propagation on this side. We argue that linear features have ordered magnetic fields and that the structure is determined by the synchrotron lifetime of particles diffusing perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. We find no significant evidence for thermal X-rays inside the filamentary envelope.},

  Abstract                 = {The polarization and extinction properties of magnetite dust grains are calculated based on indirect evidence that magnetite grains might be the interstellar polarizers. The extinction and phase-lag cross sections of magnetite grains are calculated using a computer method for nonspherical grains. From these, the linear and circular polarization which would be produced by a medium of aligned magnetite dust grains is determined. It is found that flat platelets of magnetite can reproduce the wavelength dependence of the polarization observations. Given the predictions by the Purcell (1974) 'pinwheel' mechanism of perfect alignment for such grains, it is shown that magnetite grains can produce all the observed polarization at visual wavelength by consuming roughly 16 percent of the cosmic abundance of iron atoms in the interstellar medium, while contributing roughly 4 percent of the total visual extinction. With less than perfect alignment, more iron must be put into the magnetite grains, resulting in more magnetite extinction. A general property of interstellar polarization is also discussed based upon the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. An infrared observational test of this property is proposed. },

We have discovered 28 compact continuum sources and confirmed their associations with the bubbles using velocity information from HCO+ and HCN. We have also mapped small-scale structures of N2H+ emission in the vicinity of the bubbles. By combining our data with survey data from GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, BGPS, and MAGPIS, we establish about half of our continuum sources as star-forming cores. We also use survey data with the velocity information from our molecular line observations to describe the morphology of the bubbles and the nature of the fragmentation. We conclude from the properties of the continuum sources that N74 likely is at the near kinematic distance, which was previously unconfirmed. We also present tentative evidence of molecular clouds being more fragmented on bubble rims compared to dark clouds, suggesting that triggered star formation may occur, though our findings do not conform to a classic collect-and-collapse model.},

The cloud is assumed to be small enough that radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and self-gravity can be ignored. A variety of initial orientations (including parallel, perpendicular, and oblique to the incident shock normal) and strengths for the magnetic field are investigated. During the early stages of the interaction (less than twice the time taken for the transmitted shock to cross the interior of the cloud), the structure and dynamics of the shocked cloud are fairly insensitive to the magnetic field strength and orientation. However, at late times strong fields substantially alter the dynamics of the cloud, suppressing fragmentation and mixing by stabilizing the interface at the cloud surface. Even weak magnetic fields can drastically alter the evolution of the cloud compared to the hydrodynamic case. Weak fields of different geometries result in different distributions and amplifications of the magnetic energy density, which may affect the thermal and nonthermal X-ray emission expected from shocked clouds associated with, for example, supernova remnants.},

Also, measurements of proper motions at 39 locations within the Cygnus Loop are summarized. These results show that the remnant is expanding asymmetrically into the ambient interstellar medium, with rest-frame velocities as high as 380 km/s in the near half and 150 km/s in the far half. This can plausibly be interpreted as the result of the progenitor's evolution near a density discontinuity, the consequent formation of a cavity and partial shell, and the SN's interaction with that shell. The remnant's optically observed filamentary structure results from line-of-sight effects as shock waves advance into the irregular inner surface of the shell. In this context, the derived expansion velocities and proper motions give a formal distance to the Cygnus Loop of roughly 600 pc, with 1-sigma limits of 300 and 1200 pc.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the possibility that a series of two or three supernovae in the diffuse interstellar medium might be capable of generating a long-lived hot diffuse bubble with characteristics like those inferred for the Local Bubble surrounding the Sun. Several examples of multiple supernova remnants are explored with a one-dimensional hydrocode able to follow the nonequilibrium ionization and dust destruction. The results are generalized via scaling parameters, and a set of input parameters are identified, which should in fact lead to a bubble satisfying all known constraints on size, external pressure, external density, X-ray surface brightness and band ratios, the upper limit to X-ray emission in the 0.5-1 keV range, and the O VI absorption line characteristics. The exploratory models are a unique example of the detailed behavior of hot interstellar bubbles, and their characteristics are presented in considerable detail. Included are the distributions of temperature, density, and pressure, as well as the evolutions of those distributions with time, the evolution of bubble radius during both expansion and contraction, the evolution of the X-ray emission in observed bands and specific observed lines, a diagnostic for normalizing the X-ray surface brightness to radius, pressure, and central temperature, the radial dependence of X-ray emissivity, the full X-ray and EUV spectrum, the equivalent widths of potentially observable absorption lines, the specific characteristics of the O VI absorption (column density, centroid velocity, width), the electron column density, the emission line intensities for O VI, Fe X, and Fe XIV, the degree to which dust can be expected to have been destroyed, and the effects of incomplete dust destruction on everything else. Observations have shown that the emission lines of iron from the Local Bubble are weak or absent. This is somewhat surprising, since considerable grain destruction is expected, even if only by thermal sputtering. The result is similar to other hints that much of the iron is in its own population of dust and is very resistant to destruction. In our models, having iron alone depleted by a factor of 10 makes it much easier to accommodate the X-ray emission characteristics. Having a successful model also requires that thermal conduction within the hot bubble occurs at roughly half of its full classical rate. For substantially lower thermal conductivity, the temperature is too high to get the spectral characteristics right, and the density is too low at the highest allowed pressure to achieve the observed brightness. Our fiducial model assumes that three supernovae took place in the vicinity of the Sun over a period of 3 million years, the last having occurred a few million years ago. We show that such accidental occurrences should be sufficiently common to provide about 1 chance in 30 (with considerable uncertainty) of being found within one. Certainly supernovae occur outside of OB associations, and direct evidence for a nearby supernova some 5 million years ago that could have been responsible for the latest reheating of the Local Bubble has recently been found in the excess abundance of 60Fe in a deep ocean ferromanganese crust.},

The molecular front appears at galacto-centric distance of R ˜ 8 kpc, where the galactic-scale phase transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen occurs with f_mol^ρ dropping from ˜0.8 to 0.2 within a radial interval as narrow as ˜0.5 kpc. The f_mol^ρ front is much sharper than that of the surface density molecular fraction. The f_mol^ρ front also appears in the direction vertical to the galactic plane with a full width of the high-f_mol^ρ disk to be ˜100 pc. The radial and vertical f_mol^ρ profiles, particularly the front behavior, are fitted by theoretical curves calculated using the observed density profile and assumed radiation field and metallicity with exponential gradients. The molecular fraction was found to be enhanced along spiral arms at radii R ˜ 6 to 10 kpc, such as the Perseus arm. This implies that the molecular clouds are produced from H I in the arms and are dissociated in the interarm regions in the transition region around the molecular front. We also show that there is a threshold value of mean H I density, over which H I is transformed into molecular gas.},

  Abstract                 = {We present far-UV observations of the Crab Nebula and its pulsar made with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Broad, blueshifted absorption arising in the nebula is seen in C IV λ1550, reaching a blueward velocity of ~2500 km s-1. This can be interpreted as evidence for a fast outer shell surrounding the Crab Nebula, and we adopt a spherically symmetric model to constrain the properties of such a shell. From the line profile we find that the density appears to decrease outward in the shell. A likely lower limit to the shell mass is ~0.3 Msolar with an accompanying kinetic energy of ~1.5×1049 ergs. A fast massive shell with 1051 ergs cannot be excluded but is less likely if the density profile is much steeper than ρ(R)~R-4 and the maximum velocity is <~6000 km s-1. The observations cover the region 1140-1720 Å, which is further into the ultraviolet than has previously been obtained for the pulsar. With the time-tag mode of the spectrograph we obtain the pulse profile in this spectral regime. The profile is similar to that previously obtained by us in the near-UV, although the primary peak is marginally narrower. Together with the near-UV data, and new optical data from the Nordic Optical Telescope, our spectrum of the Crab pulsar covers the entire region from 1140 to 9250 Å. Dereddening the spectrum with a standard extinction curve we achieve a flat spectrum for the reddening parameters E(B-V)=0.52, R=3.1. This dereddened spectrum of the Crab pulsar can be fitted by a power law with spectral index αν=0.11+/-0.04. The main uncertainty in determining the spectral index is the amount and characteristics of the interstellar reddening, and we have investigated the dependence of αν on E(B-V) and R. In the extended emission covered by our 25''×0.5" slit in the far-UV, we detect C IV λ1550 and He II λ1640 emission lines from the Crab Nebula. Several interstellar absorption lines are detected along the line of sight to the pulsar. The Lyα absorption indicates a column density of (3.0+/-0.5)×1021 cm-2 of neutral hydrogen, which agrees well with our estimate of E(B-V)=0.52 mag. Other lines show no evidence of severe depletion of metals in atomic gas.

The basic parameters of GSH 138-01-94 were determined by fitting the expansion of a thin shell to the expansion velocity field on the sky. The kinematic distance is 16.6 kpc for vLSR=-94.2+/-0.5kms-1. The radius is 180+/-10pc, the expansion velocity vexp=11.8+/-0.9kms-1, and the mass 2×105Msolar. No radio-continuum counterpart of the shell was detected at 21 cm or at 74 cm. Absorption of a background continuum source constrains the spin temperature of H I in the shell to Ts=230367173K. The expansion age of GSH 138-01-94 is 4.3 Myr. These observables are in excellent agreement with predictions from hydrodynamic models for a supernova remnant in a low-density, low-metallicity environment such as the outer Galaxy. GSH 138-01-94 is then the largest and the oldest supernova remnant known. It provides direct evidence for the release of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium by stars in the outer Galaxy. We argue that such old supernova remnants are to be found in low-density, low-metallicity environments such as the outer Galaxy, dwarf galaxies, and low surface brightness galaxies.},

The survey area was observed with the Very Large Array in 990 pointings. Short-spacing information for the H I line emission was obtained by additional observations with the Green Bank Telescope. H I spectral line images are presented with a resolution of 1'×1'×1.56 km s-1 (FWHM) and an rms noise of 2 K per 0.824 km s-1 channel. Continuum images made from channels without H I line emission have 1' (FWHM) resolution. The VGPS images reveal structures of atomic hydrogen and 21 cm continuum as large as several degrees with unprecedented resolution in this part of the Galaxy. With the completion of the VGPS, it is now possible for the first time to assess the consistency between arcminute-resolution surveys of Galactic H I emission. VGPS images are compared with images from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) and the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS). In general, the agreement between these surveys is impressive, considering the differences in instrumentation and image-processing techniques used for each survey. The differences between VGPS and CGPS images are small, <~6 K (rms) in channels in which the mean H I brightness temperature in the field exceeds 80 K. A similar degree of consistency is found between the VGPS and SGPS. The agreement we find between arcminute-resolution surveys of the Galactic plane is a crucial step toward combining these surveys into a single uniform data set that covers 90% of the Galactic disk: the International Galactic Plane Survey. The VGPS data will be made available on the World Wide Web through the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.},

We present the results of a series of fully three-dimensional tests which indicate the method is second-order accurate for smooth solutions in all MHD wave families, and captures shocks, contact and rotational discontinuities well. However, it is also more diffusive than other more complex unsplit integrators combined with CT. Thus, the primary advantage of the method is its simplicity. It does not require a characteristic tracing step to construct interface values for the Riemann solver, it is straightforward to extend with additional physics, and it is suitable for use with nested and adaptive meshes. The method is implemented as one of two dimensionally unsplit MHD integrators in the Athena code, which is freely available for download from the web.},

This full transport algorithm, which differs significantly from more commonly used methods based on the diffusion approximation, is applicable in both optically thin and thick media. Results computed by these algorithms on a new collection of RHD test problems are presented. For the transfer equation, very detailed tests are possible which compare the numerical solution for the specific intensity at every point on a given tangent plane to the known analytic solution. It is shown that, while the interpolation inherent in the method of short characteristics makes the solution diffusive, it is not overly so.

  Abstract                 = {During detailed searches for new Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Anglo-Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST) Hα survey of the southern Galactic plane, we also uncovered, for the first time, possible associated Hα emission in the vicinity of about 24 known Galactic SNRs previously known solely from radio or X-ray observations. The possible optical counterparts to these known SNR were detected due to the 1-arcsec resolution and 5 Rayleigh sensitivity of this Hα survey. The newly discovered emission frequently exhibits the typical filamentary form of other optically detected SNRs although sometimes the Hα emission clouds or fragmented filaments largely inside an SNR extend over the radio border. It is true that superposition of general diffuse and extended Galactic emission in the region of these remnants is a complicating factor, but for many optical candidates the Hα emission provides an excellent morphological and positional match to the observed radio emission so that an association seems clear. We have already published Hα images and confirmatory spectral observations for several of the best optical counterparts to known SNRs but for completeness and convenience we include them in our complete catalogue of previously known radio detected SNRs for which we have now uncovered Hα optical emission. For better visualization of the optical emissions from these faint supernova remnants and to enhance some low surface-brightness features we also present quotient images of the Hα data divided by the accompanying broad-band short-red data. Out of 274 Galactic SNRs currently catalogued and detected in the radio only ˜20 per cent had previous optical counterparts. We may have now increased this by a further third by adding a further 24 candidate optical counterparts.},

A characteristic νFν spectrum of an SNR consists of a peak at radio through optical energies from nonthermal electron synchrotron emission and another high-energy gamma-ray peak due primarily to secondary pion production, nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung, and Compton scattering. We find that supernova remnants are capable of producing maximum gamma-ray luminosities >~1035 ergs s-1 if the density of the local interstellar medium is >~10 cm-3. This emission will persist for >~105 yr after the supernova explosion because of the long energy loss timescales for electrons with kinetic energy ~1 GeV. This long gamma-ray lifetime implies that SNRs with a wide range of ages could be gamma-ray sources and could constitute some of the unidentified EGRET sources.},

The maximum absorption velocity of about 140 kms-1 constrains the lower limit of its distance to about 8.0 kpc. Further, the fact that the Hi emission feature at about 95 km s-1 seems to have no corresponding absorption suggests that G15.4+0.1 likely has an upper limit for distance of about 10.5 kpc.

The distance to Kes 75 has long been uncertain. Aiming to address these issues, we have made millimeter spectroscopic observations of the molecular gas toward the remnant. The V LSR~ 83-96 km s-1 molecular clouds (MCs) are found to overlap a large northwestern region of the remnant and are suggested to be located in front of the SNR along the line of sight. Also in the remnant area, the V LSR = 45-58 km s-1 MC shows a blueshifted broadening in the 12CO (J = 1-0) line profile and a perturbed position-velocity structure near the edge of the remnant, with the intensity centroid sitting in the northern area of the remnant. In particular, a cavity surrounded by a molecular shell is unveiled in the intensity map in the broadened blue wing (45-51 km s-1), and the southern molecular shell follows the bright partial SNR shell seen in X-rays, mid-infrared, and radio continuum. These observational features provide effective evidences for the association of Kes 75 with the adjacent 54 km s-1 MC. This association leads to a determination of the kinematic distance at ~10.6 kpc to the remnant, which agrees with a location at the far side of the Sagittarius arm. The morphological coincidence of the shell seen in multiwavelengths is consistent with a scenario in which the SNR shock hits a pre-existing dense shell. This dense molecular shell is suggested to likely represent the debris of the cooled, clumpy shell of the progenitor's wind bubble proximately behind the 54 km s-1 cloud. The discovery of the association with MC provides a possible explanation for the γ-ray excess of the remnant.},

The full evolution is followed using an adaptive reaction network of up to 2000 nuclei. A novel aspect of the survey is the use of a one-dimensional neutrino transport model for the explosion. This explosion model has been calibrated to give the observed energy for SN 1987A, using five standard progenitors, and for the Crab SN using a 9.6 {M}⊙ progenitor. As a result of using a calibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the SN is variable and sensitive to the structure of each pre-SN star. Many progenitors with extended core structures do not explode, but become black holes (BHs), and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set. The resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the Sun provided that a reasonable contribution from SNe Ia is also allowed, but with a deficiency of light s-process isotopes. The resulting neutron star initial mass function has a mean gravitational mass near 1.4 {M}⊙ . The average BH mass is about 9 {M}⊙ if only the helium core implodes, and 14 {M}⊙ if the entire pre-SN star collapses. Only ˜10% of SNe come from stars over 20 {M}⊙ , and some of these are Type Ib or Ic. Some useful systematics of Type IIp light curves are explored.},

Methods: We analyse data from observations taken as part of the Sino-German λ6 cm polarization survey of the Galactic plane. By using the integrated flux densities at λ6 cm together with measurements at other wavelengths from the literature, we derive the global spectra of 50 SNRs. In addition, from the observations at λ6 cm we obtain the polarization images of 24 SNRs. Results: We derive integrated flux densities at λ6 cm for 51 small SNRs with angular sizes smaller than 1°. We are able to derive global radio spectral indices in all the cases except for Cas A. For the SNRs G15.1-1.6, G16.2-2.7, G16.4-0.5, G17.4-2.3, G17.8-2.6, G20.4+0.1, G36.6+2.6, G43.9+1.6, G53.6-2.2, G55.7+3.4, G59.8+1.2, G68.6-1.2, and G113.0+0.2, the spectra have been significantly improved. From our analysis, we argue that the object G16.8-1.1 is probably an H ii region instead of a SNR. Cas A shows a secular decrease in total intensity, and we measure a flux density of 688 ± 35 Jy at λ6 cm between 2004 and 2008. We detect polarized emission from 25 SNRs. For G16.2-2.7, G69.7+1.0, G84.2-0.8, and G85.9-0.6, the polarized emission is detected for the first time confirming that they are SNRs. Conclusions: High-frequency observations of SNRs are difficult but essential to determine their spectra and measure their polarization in particular towards the inner Galaxy, where Faraday effects are important.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: Our position inside the Galaxy requires 3D-modelling to obtain the distribution of the Galactic magnetic field, cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and thermal electrons. Aims: Our intention is to find a Galactic 3D-model which agrees best with available radio observations. Methods: We constrain simulated all-sky maps in total intensity, linear polarization, and rotation measure (RM) by observations. For the simulated maps as a function of frequency we integrate in 15' wide cones the emission along the line of sight calculated from Galactic 3D-models. We test a number of large-scale magnetic field configurations and take the properties of the warm interstellar medium into account. Results: From a comparison of simulated and observed maps we are able to constrain the regular large-scale Galactic magnetic field in the disk and the halo of the Galaxy. The local regular field is 2 μG and the average random field is about 3 μG. The known local excess of synchrotron emission originating either from enhanced CR electrons or random magnetic fields is able to explain the observed high-latitude synchrotron emission. The thermal electron model (NE2001) in conjunction with a proper filling factor accounts for the observed optically thin thermal emission and low frequency absorption by optically thick emission. A coupling factor between thermal electrons and the random magnetic field component is proposed, which in addition to the small filling factor of thermal electrons increases small-scale RM fluctuations and thus accounts for the observed depolarization at 1.4 GHz. Conclusions: We conclude that an axisymmetric magnetic disk field configuration with reversals inside the solar circle fits available observations best. Out of the plane a strong toroidal magnetic field with different signs above and below the plane is needed to account for the observed high-latitude RMs. The large field strength is a consequence of the small thermal electron scale height of 1 kpc, which also limits the CR electron extent up to a height of 1 kpc not to contradict with the observed synchrotron emission out of the plane.

We present the high-resolution radio image of the supernova remnant (SNR) G57.2+0.8, which is positionally associated with SGR J1935+2154. We did not detect significant periodic radio pulsations from the magnetar, with 8σ upper limits on its flux density of 0.4 and 0.2 mJy at 326.5 and 610 MHz, respectively, for an assumed duty cycle of 10%. The corresponding 6σ upper limits at the two frequencies for any burst emission with an assumed width of 10 ms are 0.5 Jy and 63 mJy, respectively. No continuum radio point source was detected at the position of SGR J1935+2154 with a 3σ upper limit of 1.2 mJy. We also did not detect significant diffuse radio emission in a radius of 70 arc s coinciding with the recently reported diffuse X-ray emission, with a 3σ upper limit of 4.5 mJy. Using the archival HI spectra, we estimate the distance of SNR G57.2+0.8 to be 11.7 ± 2.8 kpc. Based on the measured HI column density (N H ) along this line of sight, we argue that the magnetar could be physically associated with SNR G57.2+0.8. Based on the present data, we cannot rule out either a pulsar wind nebula or a dust-scattering halo origin for the diffuse X-ray emission seen around the magnetar.},

  Abstract                 = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely considered to be sites of Galactic cosmic ray (CR) acceleration. Vela is one of the Galactic composite SNRs closest to Earth accompanied by the Vela pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) Vela X. The Vela SNR is one of the most studied remnants and it benefits from precise estimates of various physical parameters such as distance and age. Therefore, it is a perfect object for a detailed study of physical processes in SNRs. The Vela SNR expands into the highly inhomogeneous cloudy interstellar medium (ISM) and its dynamics are determined by the heating and evaporation of ISM clouds. It features an asymmetrical X-ray morphology, which is explained by the expansion into two media with different densities. This could occur if the progenitor of the Vela SNR exploded close to the edge of the stellar wind bubble of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star γ2 Velorum causing one part of the remnant to expand into the bubble. The interaction of the ejecta and the main shock of the remnant with ISM clouds causes formation of secondary shocks at which additional particle acceleration takes place. This may lead to the almost uniform distribution of relativistic particles inside the remnant. We calculate the synchrotron radio emission within the framework of the new hydrodynamical model that assumes the supernova explosion at the edge of the stellar wind bubble. The simulated radio emission agrees well with both the total radio flux from the remnant and the complicated radio morphology of the source.},

It is also consistent with the observation that the very largest late-type spirals produce approximately 10 SNe per century.

CANGAROO data taken in 1992, 1993, and 1995 indicate that the energy spectrum extends up to at least 50 TeV, without a change of the index of the power-law spectrum. The observed differential spectrum is (2.01+/-0.36)×10-13(E/7w TeV)-2.53+/-0.18 TeV-1 cm-2 s-1 between 7 and 50 TeV. There is no apparent cutoff. The spectrum for photon energies above ~10 TeV allows the maximum particle acceleration energy to be inferred and implies that this unpulsed emission does not originate near the light cylinder of the pulsar but in the nebula, where the magnetic field is not strong enough to allow pair creation from the TeV photons. The hard gamma-ray energy spectrum above 10 TeV also provides information about the varying role of seed photons for the inverse Compton process at these high energies, as well as a possible contribution of π° gamma rays from proton collisions.},

  Abstract                 = {We have re-analyzed the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data to derive rotation measures (RMs) toward 37,543 polarized radio sources. The resulting catalog of RM values covers the sky area north of declination -40° with an average density of more than one RM per square degree. We present an image of the median RM over 82% of the sky with a resolution of 8° and a typical error of ±1-2 rad m-2. The image shows large-scale structures in RM that extend to very high Galactic latitudes. A simple analysis of the RM structure at high Galactic latitudes is used to derive properties of the Galactic halo magnetic field in the solar neighborhood. We find the component of the local field perpendicular to the plane (the z-component) equal to +0.30 μG for z < 0 and -0.14 μG for z>0. The reversal of sign across the Galactic plane is consistent with a quadrupole field geometry for the poloidal component of the halo field. The halo magnetic field component parallel to the disk is also found to be antisymmetric and generally consistent with a toroidal field, with strength +0.83 μG for z < 0 and -0.39 μG for z>0. We have identified five regions of the sky where the foreground median RM is consistently less than 1 rad m-2 over several degrees. These holes in the foreground RM will be useful for future studies of possible small-scale fluctuations in cosmic magnetic field structures. In addition to allowing measurement of RMs toward polarized sources, the new analysis of the NVSS data removes the effects of bandwidth depolarization for |RM| gsim 100 rad m-2 inherent in the original NVSS source catalog. This new catalog of RMs and polarized flux densities is available online, and will be a valuable resource for further studies of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetoionic medium, and extragalactic magnetic fields.},

The 8.0 μm image, made with a bandpass that includes [Ar II] 7.0 μm, resembles the general morphology of visible Hα and near-IR [Fe II] line emission, while the 3.6 and 4.5 μm images are dominated by continuum synchrotron emission. The 24 and 70 μm images show enhanced emission that may be due to line emission or the presence of a small amount of warm dust in the nebula on the order of less than 1% of a solar mass. The ratio of the 3.6 and 4.5 μm images reveals a spatial variation in the synchrotron power-law index ranging from approximately 0.3 to 0.8 across the nebula. Combining this information with optical and X-ray synchrotron images, we derive a broadband spectrum that reflects the superposition of the flatter spectrum of the jet and torus with the steeper spectrum of the diffuse nebula. We also see suggestions of the expected pileup of relativistic electrons just before the exponential cutoff in the X-ray. The pulsar, and the associated equatorial toroid and polar jet structures seen in Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope images (Hester et al. 2002), can be identified in all of the IRAC images. We present the IR photometry of the pulsar. The forbidden lines identified in the high-resolution IR spectra are all double due to Doppler shifts from the front and back of the expanding nebula and give an expansion velocity of ~1264 km s-1.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent infrared (IR) observations of freshly formed dust in supernova remnants have yielded significantly lower dust masses than predicted by theoretical models and measured from high-redshift observations. The Crab Nebula's pulsar wind is thought to be sweeping up freshly formed supernova (SN) dust along with the ejected gas. The evidence for this dust was found in the form of an IR excess in the integrated spectrum of the Crab and in extinction against the synchrotron nebula that revealed the presence of dust in the filament cores. We present the first spatially resolved emission spectra of dust in the Crab Nebula acquired with the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IR spectra are dominated by synchrotron emission and show forbidden line emission from S, Si, Ne, Ar, O, Fe, and Ni. We derived a synchrotron spectral map from the 3.6 and 4.5 μm images, and subtracted this contribution from our data to produce a map of the residual continuum emission from dust. The dust emission appears to be concentrated along the ejecta filaments and is well described by an amorphous carbon or silicate grain compositions. We find a dust temperature of 55 ± 4 K for silicates and 60 ± 7 K for carbon grains. The total estimated dust mass is (1.2-12) × 10-3 M ⊙, well below the theoretical dust yield predicted for a core-collapse supernova. Our grain heating model implies that the dust grain radii are relatively small, unlike what is expected for dust grains formed in a Type IIP SN.},

We reproduce the 100 m-Effelsberg HB3 image at 2695 MHz at large scale, and find that there exists a background emission gradient across the HB3 area. Based on our analysis of background emission and the boundary between W3 and HB3, we give HB3's flux density as 68.6±11.5 Jy at 408 MHz and 44.8±12.0 Jy at 1420 MHz, after subtracting flux from compact sources within HB3. The integrated flux-density-based spectral index between 408 MHz and 1420 MHz is 0.34±0.15. The averaged T-T plot spectral index using all subareas is 0.36. Our measurement values are less than a previously published value of 0.6. The 408-1420 MHz spectral index varies spatially in HB3 in the range 0.1 to 0.7. We investigate the data used by previous authors, and consider more data at 232 MHz, 3650 MHz and 3900 MHz which are not included in previous calculations. There is evidence for two spectral indices for HB3 in the radio band, i.e., 0.63 (38-610 MHz) and 0.32 (408-3900 MHz). This is consistent with the spatial variations: the low frequency data mainly reflects the steeper indices and the high frequency data mainly reflects the flatter indices.},

We construct H I absorption spectra of SNR W51C, H II regions G49.2-0.35 and G49.1-0.38 in W51B, and a nearby compact extragalactic source. Our study detects high-velocity (HV) H I clouds (above 83 km s-1) that coincide with W51B, but finds that the clouds are behind W51B. Both W51C and G49.2-0.35 have similar highest velocity absorption features at ~70 km s-1. The H II region G49.1-0.38 is behind the SNR because its H I absorption spectrum has a feature at 83 km s-1. These new results argue against previous claims that the SNR has shocked the HV H I clouds. Therefore, the TeV emission from the complex should not be associated with the HV H I clouds. W51C has a distance of about 4.3 kpc, smaller than the tangent point distance of 5.5 kpc in that direction, but still in the Sagittarius spiral arm.},

We analyze the 21 cm continuum, H I, and 12CO-line data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey in the direction of SN 1572 and the surrounding region. We construct H I absorption spectra to SN 1572 and three nearby compact sources. We conclude that SN 1572 has no molecular cloud interaction, which argues against previous claims that a molecular cloud is interacting with the SNR. This new result does not support a recent claim that dust, newly detected by AKARI, originates from such an SNR-cloud interaction. We suggest that the SNR has a kinematic distance of 2.5-3.0 kpc based on a nonlinear rotational curve model. Very high energy γ-ray emission from the remnant has been detected by the VERITAS telescope, so our result shows that its origin should not be an SNR-cloud interaction. Both radio and X-ray observations support that SN 1572 is an isolated Type Ia SNR.},

For Kes 69, the highest velocity of absorption is ~86 km s-1 and a prominent HI emission feature at ~112 km s-1 has no respective absorption.

The H I images show prominent absorption features associated with Kes 73 and the H II regions. The absorption appears up to the tangent point velocity giving a lower distance limit to Kes 73 of 7.5 kpc, which has previously been given as the upper limit. In addition, G27.276+0.148 and G27.491+0.189 are at the far kinematic distances of their radio recombination line velocities.

High-resolution 13CO images reveal that molecular clouds overlap the radio filaments of G18.8+0.3. The 13CO emission spectrum over the full velocity range in the direction of G18.8+0.3 shows two molecular components with high brightness-temperature and three molecular components with low brightness-temperature, all with respective HI absorption. This implies that these clouds are in front of G18.8+0.3. In the HI images, the highest velocity absorption feature seen against the continuum image of G18.8+0.3 is at 129 km s-1, which corresponds to the tangent point in this direction. This yields a lower distance limit of 6.9 kpc for G18.8+0.3. Absence of absorption at negative velocities gives an upper distance limit of 15 kpc. The broadened profile at 20±5 km s-1 in the 13CO emission spectra is a strong indicator of a possible SNR/CO cloud interaction. Thus, G18.8+0.3 is likely to be at the distance of about 12 kpc. The upper mass limit and mean density of the giant CO cloud at 20± 5 km s-1 are ~6 × 105 M⊙ and ~2× 102 cm-3. We find an atomic hydrogen column density in front of G18.8+0.3 of N_HI ˜ 2×1022 cm-2. The ROSAT PSPC observations show a diffuse X-ray enhancement apparently associated with part of the radio shell of G18.8+0.3.

New H I observations from the VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) show unambiguous structures associated with W41 in the radial velocity range of 53-63 km s-1, so we obtain for W41 a distance of 4+/-0.2 kpc. A new higher sensitivity VGPS continuum image of W41 at 1420 MHz shows faint emission in its eastern part not detected by previous observations, so we provide a new angular size of 36'×30' in the b-l direction (average radius of 19 pc). We estimate for W41 an age of ~105 yr. A new XMM-Newton observation reveals diffuse X-ray emission within the HESS source and suggests an association between the X-ray and γ-ray emission. The high-resolution 13CO images of W41 further reveal a giant molecular cloud (GMC) located at the center of W41, likely associated with W41 in the radial velocity range of 61-66 km s-1. Altogether, the new observations can be interpreted as providing the first evidence that an old SNR encounters a GMC to emit TeV γ-rays in the cloud material.},

  Abstract                 = {We present new 3D numerical simulations for Kepler's supernova remnant. In this work we revisit the possibility that the asymmetric shape of the remnant in X-rays is the product of a Type Ia supernova explosion which occurs inside the wind bubble previously created by an AGB companion star. Due to the large peculiar velocity of the system, the interaction of the strong AGB wind with the interstellar medium results in a bow shock structure. In this new model we propose that the AGB wind is anisotropic, with properties such as mass-loss rate and density having a latitude dependence, and that the orientation of the polar axis of the AGB star is not aligned with the direction of motion. The ejecta from the Type Ia supernova explosion is modelled using a power-law density profile, and we let the remnant evolve for 400 yr. We computed synthetic X-ray maps from the numerical results. We find that the estimated size and peculiar X-ray morphology of Kepler's supernova remnant are well reproduced by considering an AGB mass-loss rate of 10-5 M⊙ yr-1, a wind terminal velocity of 10 km s-1, an ambient medium density of 10-3 cm-3 and an explosion energy of 7 × 1050 erg. The obtained total X-ray luminosity of the remnant in this model reaches 6 × 1050 erg, which is within a factor of 2 of the observed value, and the time evolution of the luminosity shows a rate of decrease in recent decades of ˜2.4 per cent yr-1 that is consistent with the observations.},

A blowout is produced when the remnant reaches the border of the cloud. We have then used the results of our hydrodynamical simulations to calculate synthetic synchrotron radio emission maps, as well as synthetic X-ray maps. For some combinations of the particle acceleration mechanism and the direction of the line of sight, our radio maps display the peculiar morphology of G352.7-0.1 and reproduce the correct relative sizes of the main observed features.

  Abstract                 = {We conduct an analytic and numerical study of the dynamics of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution from the ejecta-dominated stage through the Sedov-Taylor (ST) stage, the stages that precede the onset of dynamically significant radiative losses and/or pressure confinement by the ambient medium. We assume spherical symmetry and focus on the evolution of ejecta described by a power-law density distribution expanding into a uniform ambient medium. We emphasize that all nonradiative remnants of a given power-law structure evolve according to a single unified solution, and we discuss this general property in detail. Use of dimensionless quantities constructed from the characteristic dimensional parameters of the problem--the ejecta energy, ejecta mass, and ambient density--makes the unified nature of the solution manifest. It is also possible to obtain a unified solution for the ST and radiative stages of evolution, and we place our work in the context of scaling laws for solutions for SNR evolution in those stages. We present numerical simulations of the flow and approximate analytic solutions for the motions of both the reverse shock and blast-wave shock. These solutions follow the shocks through the nonradiative stages of remnant evolution across periods of self-similar flow linked by non-self-similar behavior. We elucidate the dependence of the ejecta-dominated evolution on the ejecta power-law index n by developing a general trajectory for all n and explaining its relation to the solutions of Chevalier and Nadyozhin for n>5 and Hamilton & Sarazin for n=0. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our analytic solutions and numerical simulations. These solutions should be valuable in describing remnants such as SN 1006, Tycho, Kepler, Cassiopeia A, and other relatively young SNRs that are between the early ejecta-dominated stage and the late Sedov-Taylor stage. In appendices, we extend our results to power-law ambient media, and we describe an early period of the evolution in which the SNR is radiative and evolves according to a nonunified solution.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims: We searched for a fast moving Hα shell around the Crab nebula. Such a shell could account for this supernova remnant's missing mass, and carry enough kinetic energy to make SN 1054 a normal type II event. Methods: Deep Hα images were obtained with WFI at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope and with MOSCA at the 2.56 m NOT. The data are compared with theoretical expectations derived from shell models with ballistic gas motion, constant temperature, constant degree of ionisation, and a power law for the density profile. Results: We reach a surface brightness limit of 5 × 10-8 erg s-1 cm-2 sr-1. A halo is detected, but at a much higher surface brightness than our models of recombination emission and dust scattering predict. Only collisional excitation of Lyβ with partial de-excitation to Hα could explain such amplitudes. We show that the halo seen is caused by PSF scattering and thus not related to a real shell. We also investigated the feasibility of a spectroscopic detection of high-velocity Hα gas towards the centre of the Crab nebula. Modelling the emission spectra shows that such gas easily evades detection in the complex spectral environment of the Hα-line. Conclusions: PSF scattering significantly contaminates our data, preventing a detection of the predicted fast shell. A real halo with observed peak flux of about 2 × 10-7 erg s-1 cm-2 sr-1 could still be accomodated within our error bars, but our models predict a factor 4 lower surface brightness. Eight meters class telescopes could detect such fluxes unambiguously, provided that a sufficiently accurate PSF model is available. Finally, we note that PSF scattering also affects other research areas where faint haloes are searched for around bright and extended targets.

  Abstract                 = {Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are widely believed to be accelerated by shock waves associated with the expansion of supernova ejecta into the interstellar medium. A key issue in this long-standing conjecture is a theoretical prediction that the interstellar magnetic field can be substantially amplified at the shock of a young supernova remnant (SNR) through magnetohydrodynamic waves generated by cosmic rays. Here we report a discovery of the brightening and decay of X-ray hot spots in the shell of the SNR RXJ1713.7-3946 on a one-year timescale. This rapid variability shows that the X-rays are produced by ultrarelativistic electrons through a synchrotron process and that electron acceleration does indeed take place in a strongly magnetized environment, indicating amplification of the magnetic field by a factor of more than 100. The X-ray variability also implies that we have witnessed the ongoing shock-acceleration of electrons in real time. Independently, broadband X-ray spectrometric measurements of RXJ1713.7-3946 indicate that electron acceleration proceeds in the most effective (`Bohm-diffusion') regime. Taken together, these two results provide a strong argument for acceleration of protons and nuclei to energies of 1PeV (1015eV) and beyond in young supernova remnants.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the Chandra results of AX J1843.8-0352, a supernova remnant (SNR) recently identified with ASCA. Chandra spatially resolved two components from this SNR: one nonthermal and one thermal. The morphology of the nonthermal component is clumpy and elliptical, elongated from the north to the south with a mean diameter of about 9'. The spectrum is fitted with a power-law model of photon index 2.1, and the east rim is associated with the nonthermal radio sources C and F. Therefore, the nonthermal component is probably synchrotron X-rays produced by energetic electrons accelerated at the shell of the SNR. The thermal component is the brightest clump located within the nonthermal component and shows the spectrum of a thin plasma of about 0.7 keV temperature. A notable discovery is its peculiar morphology; a head of 50''×30'' size near the southeast rim of the SNR and a 30" long ``jet'' pointing to the southwest. Although this emission is associated with the western part of the radio source F, the absorption is 2 times larger than that of the nonthermal X-rays or the bulk of the SNR emission. Therefore, it is unclear whether this peculiar plasma is a thermal component associated with AX J1843.8-0352, a Galactic source located in the far side of our Galaxy, or an extragalactic source.},

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that amplification of the magnetic field in supernova remnants (SNRs) occurs in all six objects where morphological measurements are presently available in the hard X-ray continuum at several keV. For the three archetypical objects (SN 1006, Cas A and Tycho's SNR) to which nonlinear time-dependent acceleration theory has been successfully applied up to now, the global theoretical and the local observational field strengths agree very well, suggesting in addition that all young SNRs exhibit the amplification effect as a result of very efficient acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays (CRs) at the outer shock. Since this appears to be empirically the case, we may reverse the argument and consider field amplification as a measure of nuclear CR acceleration and it has indeed been argued that acceleration in the amplified fields allows the CR spectrum from SNRs to reach the knee in the spectrum or, in special objects, even beyond. The above results are furthermore used to investigate the time evolution of field amplification in young SNRs. Although the uncertainties in the data do not allow precise conclusions regarding this point, they rather clearly show that the ratio of the magnetic field energy density and the kinetic energy density of gas flow into the shock is of the order of a few percent if the shock speed is high enough V_s>103 km s-1, and this ratio remains nearly constant during the SNR evolution. The escape of the highest energy nuclear particles from their sources becomes progressively important with age, reducing also the cutoff in the π^0-decay gamma-ray emission spectrum with time after the end of the sweep-up phase. Simultaneously the leptonic gamma-ray channels will gain in relative importance with increasing age of the sources.},

Presently, we do not have suitable low-cost IR detectors to observe single photons, however some OH-molecular excitations extend to visible and UV wavelengths and can be measured by bialkali photocathodes. There are many other chemical substances with diatomic molecules, or more complex oil molecules, which could be also investigated. This idea invites searches in experiments having large target volumes of such materials coupled to a large array of single-photon detectors with bialkali or infrared-sensitive photocathodes.},

This catalog fills in gaps in the RM coverage of the Galactic plane between the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey and Southern Galactic Plane Survey. Using this catalog we have tested the validity of recently proposed axisymmetric and bisymmetric models of the large-scale (or regular) Galactic magnetic field, and found that of the existing models we tested, an axisymmetric spiral model with reversals occurring in rings (as opposed to along spiral arms) best matched our observations. Building on this, we have performed our own modeling, using RMs from both extragalactic sources and pulsars. By developing independent models for the magnetic field in the outer and inner Galaxy, we conclude that in the inner Galaxy, the magnetic field closely follows the spiral arms, while in the outer Galaxy, the field is consistent with being purely azimuthal. Furthermore, the models contain no reversals in the outer Galaxy, and together seem to suggest the existence of a single reversed region that spirals out from the Galactic center.},

Such interaction is depicted by combining a grid-based magnetohydrodynamics description of the thermal fluid with particle in cell techniques devoted to the dynamics of suprathermal particles. This approach, which incorporates the use of adaptive mesh refinement features, is potentially a key to simulate astrophysical systems on spatial scales that are beyond the reach of pure particle-in-cell simulations. We consider in this study non-relativistic shocks with various Alfvénic Mach numbers and magnetic field obliquity. We recover all the features of both magnetic field amplification and particle acceleration from previous studies when the magnetic field is parallel to the normal to the shock. In contrast with previous particle-in-cell-hybrid simulations, we find that particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification also occur when the magnetic field is oblique to the normal to the shock but on larger time-scales than in the parallel case. We show that in our simulations, the suprathermal particles are experiencing acceleration thanks to a pre-heating process of the particle similar to a shock drift acceleration leading to the corrugation of the shock front. Such oscillations of the shock front and the magnetic field locally help the particles to enter the upstream region and to initiate a non-resonant streaming instability and finally to induce diffuse particle acceleration.},

Understanding the various mechanisms that give rise to these extended structures is important to trace their mass-loss history. Aims: Here, we aim to examine the role of the interstellar magnetic field in shaping the extended morphologies of slow dusty winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in an effort to pin-point the origin of so-called eye shaped CSEs of three carbon-rich AGB stars. In addition, we seek to understand if this pre-planetary nebula (PN) shaping can be responsible for asymmetries observed in PNe. Methods: Hydrodynamical simulations are used to study the effect of typical interstellar magnetic fields on the free-expanding spherical stellar winds as they sweep up the local interstellar medium (ISM). Results: The simulations show that typical Galactic interstellar magnetic fields of 5 to 10 μG are sufficient to alter the spherical expanding shells of AGB stars to appear as the characteristic eye shape revealed by far-infrared observations. The typical sizes of the simulated eyes are in accordance with the observed physical sizes. However, the eye shapes are transient in nature. Depending on the stellar and interstellar conditions, they develop after 20 000 to 200 000 yrs and last for about 50 000 to 500 000 yrs, assuming that the star is at rest relative to the local interstellar medium. Once formed, the eye shape develops lateral outflows parallel to the magnetic field. The explosion of a PN in the centre of the eye-shaped dust shell gives rise to an asymmetrical nebula with prominent inward pointing Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Conclusions: Interstellar magnetic fields can clearly affect the shaping of wind-ISM interaction shells. The occurrence of the eyes is most strongly influenced by stellar space motion and ISM density. Observability of this transient phase is favoured for lines-of-sight perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field direction. The simulations indicate that shaping of the pre-PN envelope can strongly affect the shape and size of PNe.

  Abstract                 = {Context. Many evolved stars travel through space at supersonic velocities, which leads to the formation of bow shocks ahead of the star where the stellar wind collides with the interstellar medium (ISM). Herschel observations of the bow shock of α-Orionis show that the shock is almost free of instabilities, despite being, at least in theory, subject to both Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Aims: A possible explanation for the lack of instabilities lies in the presence of an interstellar magnetic field. We wish to investigate whether the magnetic field of the ISM in the Orion arm can inhibit the growth of instabilities in the bow shock of α-Orionis. Methods: We used the code MPI-AMRVAC to make magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a circumstellar bow shock, using the wind parameters derived for α-Orionis and interstellar magnetic field strengths of B = 1.4, 3.0, and 5.0 μG, which fall within the boundaries of the observed magnetic field strength in the Orion arm of the Milky Way. Results: Our results show that even a relatively weak magnetic field in the ISM can suppress the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, which occur along the contact discontinuity between the shocked wind and the shocked ISM. Conclusions: The presence of even a weak magnetic field in the ISM effectively inhibits the growth of instabilities in the bow shock. This may explain the absence of such instabilities in the Herschel observations of α-Orionis. Appendix A and associated movies are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

  Abstract                 = {Context. Massive stars shape their surrounding medium through the force of their stellar winds, which collide with the circumstellar medium. Because the characteristics of these stellar winds vary over the course of the evolution of the star, the circumstellar matter becomes a reflection of the stellar evolution and can be used to determine the characteristics of the progenitor star. In particular, whenever a fast wind phase follows a slow wind phase, the fast wind sweeps up its predecessor in a shell, which is observed as a circumstellar nebula. Aims: We make 2D and 3D numerical simulations of fast stellar winds sweeping up their slow predecessors to investigate whether numerical models of these shells have to be 3D, or whether 2D models are sufficient to reproduce the shells correctly. Methods: We use the MPI-AMRVAC code, using hydrodynamics with optically thin radiative losses included, to make numerical models of circumstellar shells around massive stars in 2D and 3D and compare the results. We focus on those situations where a fast Wolf-Rayet star wind sweeps up the slower wind emitted by its predecessor, being either a red supergiant or a luminous blue variable. Results: As the fast Wolf-Rayet wind expands, it creates a dense shell of swept up material that expands outward, driven by the high pressure of the shocked Wolf-Rayet wind. These shells are subject to a fair variety of hydrodynamic-radiative instabilities. If the Wolf-Rayet wind is expanding into the wind of a luminous blue variable phase, the instabilities will tend to form a fairly small-scale, regular filamentary lattice with thin filaments connecting knotty features. If the Wolf-Rayet wind is sweeping up a red supergiant wind, the instabilities will form larger interconnected structures with less regularity. The numerical resolution must be high enough to resolve the compressed, swept-up shell and the evolving instabilities, which otherwise may not even form. Conclusions: Our results show that 3D models, when translated to observed morphologies, give realistic results that can be compared directly to observations. The 3D structure of the nebula will help to distinguish different progenitor scenarios.},

In this wind-interstellar-medium collision, the familiar bow shock, contact discontinuity, and wind termination shock morphology form, with localized instability development. Our model includes a detailed treatment of dust grains in the stellar wind and takes into account the drag forces between dust and gas. The dust is treated as pressureless gas components binned per grain size, for which we use 10 representative grain size bins. Our simulations allow us to deduce how dust grains of varying sizes become distributed throughout the circumstellar medium. We show that smaller dust grains (radius <0.045 μm) tend to be strongly bound to the gas and therefore follow the gas density distribution closely, with intricate fine structure due to essentially hydrodynamical instabilities at the wind-related contact discontinuity. Larger grains which are more resistant to drag forces are shown to have their own unique dust distribution, with progressive deviations from the gas morphology. Specifically, small dust grains stay entirely within the zone bound by shocked wind material. The large grains are capable of leaving the shocked wind layer and can penetrate into the shocked or even unshocked interstellar medium. Depending on how the number of dust grains varies with grain size, this should leave a clear imprint in infrared observations of bow shocks of red supergiants and other evolved stars.},

  Abstract                 = {Context. The winds of massive stars create large (>10 pc) bubbles around their progenitors. As these bubbles expand they encounter the interstellar coherent magnetic field which, depending on its strength, can influence the shape of the bubble. Aims: We wish to investigate if, and how much, the interstellar magnetic field can contribute to the shape of an expanding circumstellar bubble around a massive star. Methods: We use the MPI-AMRVAC code to make magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of bubbles, using a single star model, combined with several different field strengths: B = 5, 10, and 20 μG for the interstellar magnetic field. This covers the typical field strengths of the interstellar magnetic fields found in the galactic disk and bulge. Furthermore, we present two simulations that include both a 5 μG interstellar magnetic field and a warm (10 000 K) interstellar medium (ISM) and two different ISM densities to demonstrate how the magnetic field can combine with other external factors to influence the morphology of the circumstellar bubbles. Results: Our results show that low magnetic fields, as found in the galactic disk, inhibit the growth of the circumstellar bubbles in the direction perpendicular to the field. As a result, the bubbles become ovoid, rather than spherical. Strong interstellar fields, such as observed for the galactic bulge, can completely stop the expansion of the bubble in the direction perpendicular to the field, leading to the formation of a tube-like bubble. When combined with an ISM that is both warm and high density the bubble is greatly reduced in size, causing a dramatic change in the evolution of temporary features inside the bubble such as Wolf-Rayet ring nebulae. Conclusions: The magnetic field of the interstellar medium can affect the shape of circumstellar bubbles. This effect may have consequences for the shape and evolution of circumstellar nebulae and supernova remnants, which are formed within the main wind-blown bubble.

  Abstract                 = {Context. Numerical models of the wind-blown bubble of massive stars usually only account for the wind of a single star. However, since massive stars are usually formed in clusters, it would be more realistic to follow the evolution of a bubble created by several stars. Aims: We develop a two-dimensional (2D) model of the circumstellar bubble created by two massive stars, a 40 M⊙ star and a 25 M⊙ star, and follow its evolution. The stars are separated by approximately 16 pc and surrounded by a cold medium with a density of 20 particles per cm3. Methods: We use the MPI-AMRVAC hydrodynamics code to solve the conservation equations of hydrodynamics on a 2D cylindrical grid using time-dependent models for the wind parameters of the two stars. At the end of the stellar evolution (4.5 and 7.0 million years for the 40 and 25 M⊙ stars, respectively), we simulate the supernova explosion of each star. Results: Each star initially creates its own bubble. However, as the bubbles expand they merge, creating a combined, aspherical bubble. The combined bubble evolves over time, influenced by the stellar winds and supernova explosions. Conclusions: The evolution of a wind-blown bubble created by two stars deviates from that of the bubbles around single stars. In particular, once one of the stars has exploded, the bubble is too large for the wind of the remaining star to maintain and the outer shell starts to disintegrate. The lack of thermal pressure inside the bubble also changes the behavior of circumstellar features close to the remaining star. The supernovae are contained inside the bubble, which reflects part of the energy back into the circumstellar medium. Movies are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

  Abstract                 = {Stars can produce steady-state winds through radiative driving as long as the mechanical luminosity of the wind does not exceed the radiative luminosity at its base. This upper bound on the mass-loss rate is known as the photon-tiring limit. Once above this limit, the radiation field is unable to lift all the material out of the gravitational potential of the star, such that only part of it can escape and reach infinity. The rest stalls and falls back towards the stellar surface, making a steady-state wind impossible. Photon-tiring is not an issue for line-driven winds since they cannot achieve sufficiently high mass-loss rates. It can, however, become important if the star exceeds the Eddington limit and continuum interaction becomes the dominant driving mechanism. This paper investigates the time-dependent behaviour of stellar winds that exceed the photon-tiring limit, using one-dimensional numerical simulations of a porosity-moderated, continuum-driven stellar wind. We find that the regions close to the star show a hierarchical pattern of high-density shells moving back and forth, unable to escape the gravitational potential of the star. At larger distances, the flow eventually becomes uniformly outward, though still quite variable. Typically, these winds have a very high density but a terminal flow speed well below the escape speed at the stellar surface. Since most of the radiative luminosity of the star is used to drive the stellar wind, such stars would appear much dimmer than expected from the super-Eddington energy generation at their core. The visible luminosity typically constitutes less than half of the total energy flow and can become as low as 10 per cent or less for those stars that exceed the photon-tiring limit by a large margin.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the results of numerical simulations of continuum-driven winds of stars that exceed the Eddington limit and compare these against predictions from earlier analytical solutions. Our models are based on the assumption that the stellar atmosphere consists of clumped matter, where the individual clumps have a much larger optical thickness than the matter between the clumps. This `porosity' of the stellar atmosphere reduces the coupling between radiation and matter, since photons tend to escape through the more tenuous gas between the clumps. This allows a star that formally exceeds the Eddington limit to remain stable, yet produce a steady outflow from the region where the clumps become optically thin. We have made a parameter study of wind models for a variety of input conditions in order to explore the properties of continuum-driven winds. The results show that the numerical simulations reproduce quite closely the analytical scalings. The mass-loss rates produced in our models are much larger than can be achieved by line driving. This makes continuum driving a good mechanism to explain the large mass-loss and flow speeds of giant outbursts, as observed in η Carinae and other luminous blue variable stars. Continuum driving may also be important in population III stars, since line driving becomes ineffective at low metallicities. We also explore the effect of photon tiring and the limits it places on the wind parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent observations of luminous Type IIn supernovae (SNe) provide compelling evidence that massive circumstellar shells surround their progenitors. In this paper we investigate how the properties of such shells influence the SN light curve by conducting numerical simulations of the interaction between an expanding SN and a circumstellar shell ejected a few years prior to core collapse. Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a range of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries and wind mass-loss rates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell mass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or higher ratios of Mshell/MSN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher efficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells can also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta are very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for durations of more than 100 d requires massive circumstellar shells of the order of 10 Msolar or more. This reaffirms previous comparisons between pre-SN shells and shells produced by giant eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs), although the physical mechanism responsible for these outbursts remains uncertain. The light-curve shape and observed shell velocity can help diagnose the approximate size and density of the circumstellar shell, and it may be possible to distinguish between spherical and bipolar shells with multi-wavelength light curves. These models are merely illustrative. One can, of course, achieve even higher luminosities and longer duration light curves from interaction by increasing the explosion energy and shell mass beyond values adopted here.},

We follow the temporal evolution of the shock fronts that are formed through such an interaction and determine the velocities, temperatures, and densities. We model the X-ray emission from the supernova remnant-stellar wind collision region, and we compare it with recent results from X-ray observations carried out with the Chandra satellite of the SMC supernova remnant SNR 0057-7226, which could be interacting with the wind of the Wolf-Rayet system HD 5980. The simulations predict the presence of shell-like regions of enhanced X-ray emission that are consistent with the presence of X-ray-emitting arcs in the Chandra image. Also, the observed X-ray luminosity is comparable to the X-ray luminosities we obtain from the simulations for a supernova with an initial energy in the (1-5)×1050 ergs range.},

One of the proposed mechanisms has been the presence of thermal conduction, which can raise the density at the center of SNRs, increasing the X-ray emission from these regions. In this work, we have carried out axisymmetric numerical simulations with the adaptive grid Yguazú-a code, which includes advection of the magnetic field and thermal conduction. We have considered cases with anisotropic and isotropic thermal conduction, as well as with no conduction. We have simulated X-ray (as well as radio synchrotron) emission maps from our numerical simulations, which can be directly compared with observations.},

Our results show that a turbulent medium with an adiabatic index of 1.3 can reproduce the polarization properties of the SN 1006 remnant. This statistical study reveals itself as a useful tool for obtaining the orientation of the ambient magnetic field, previous to be swept up by the main supernova remnant shock.},

  Abstract                 = {We present two-dimensional numerical simulations of a model for Kepler's supernova remnant (SNR) carried out with the YGUAZÚ-A code. Following previous studies, we have assumed that the peculiar shape of this young remnant arises as a consequence of the interaction of the SNR blast wave with the bow shock formed by the wind of its high velocity progenitor. Furthermore, from our numerical results we have obtained synthetic X-ray emission maps, which can be directly compared with recent and previous observations of this SNR. Our models show that a nice fit with respect to the X-ray morphology and luminosity is obtained for a SN progenitor with mass-loss rate of 5×10-5 Msolar yr-1, an ambient medium density of 10-2 cm-3, an initial explosion energy of 8×1050 ergs, and a total ejected mass within 1.4-2.5 Msolar. In our simulations, parameters typical of a young population progenitor have not been considered. This model also predicts a ~0.3% yearly decrease in the total X-ray luminosity, which is consistent with observed values. The parameters employed in our runs correspond to a Type Ia supernova. Based on our simulations, we find that the expansion rate increases after the SNR blast wave overruns the bow shock, and we discuss whether this can explain the observed difference between the expansion rates measured from sequences of radio and X-ray images.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate distances to pulsars can be used for a variety of studies of the Galaxy and its electron content. However, most distance measures to pulsars have been derived from the absorption (or lack thereof) of pulsar emission by Galactic H I gas, which typically implies that only upper or lower limits on the pulsar distance are available. We present a critical analysis of all measured H I distance limits to pulsars and other neutron stars, and translate these limits into actual distance estimates through a likelihood analysis that simultaneously corrects for statistical biases. We also apply this analysis to parallax measurements of pulsars in order to obtain accurate distance estimates and find that the parallax and H I distance measurements are biased in different ways, because of differences in the sampled populations. Parallax measurements typically underestimate a pulsar's distance because of the limited distance to which this technique works and the consequential strong effect of the Galactic pulsar distribution (i.e., the original Lutz-Kelker bias), in H I distance limits, however, the luminosity bias dominates the Lutz-Kelker effect, leading to overestimated distances because the bright pulsars on which this technique is applicable are more likely to be nearby given their brightness.},

  Abstract                 = {We present two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical simulations of asymmetric young supernova remnants (SNRs) carried out with the hydrodynamical code YGUAZÚ, aiming to quantitatively assess the role of different factors that may give origin to such asymmetries in their expansion. In particular, we are interested in modeling the morphology of Tycho's SNR to address whether the companion star of a Type Ia supernova progenitor has played a role in the subsequent evolution of the remnant. With the results from the numerical simulations, we can not only study the morphology of the SNR but also compute the emission of the remnant in different spectral bands. In particular, we simulate X-ray maps, which can be directly compared to recent and previous observations of Tycho's SNR. Our results suggest that the most likely explanation for Tycho's morphology is that after the supernova (SN) explosion the shock front stripped the envelope of its companion. We represent this effect by adding a conical region with an enhanced density into the initial sphere immediately after the explosion. Assuming that Tycho's companion was a massive red giant star, we explore different values of the angle of aperture and mass excess of the conical region. A good agreement with observational data was found for the model with a mass excess of 0.3 M sun and an aperture of 90°. After the collision with the SN shock wave, the companion would become an He-rich star. This scenario would gain observational support if a star with these characteristics is found in the vicinity of the center of the SN explosion.},

  Abstract                 = {Supernova remnants are beautiful astronomical objects that are also of high scientific interest, because they provide insights into supernova explosion mechanisms, and because they are the likely sources of Galactic cosmic rays. X-ray observations are an important means to study these objects. And in particular the advances made in X-ray imaging spectroscopy over the last two decades has greatly increased our knowledge about supernova remnants. It has made it possible to map the products of fresh nucleosynthesis, and resulted in the identification of regions near shock fronts that emit X-ray synchrotron radiation. Since X-ray synchrotron radiation requires 10-100 TeV electrons, which lose their energies rapidly, the study of X-ray synchrotron radiation has revealed those regions where active and rapid particle acceleration is taking place. In this text all the relevant aspects of X-ray emission from supernova remnants are reviewed and put into the context of supernova explosion properties and the physics and evolution of supernova remnants. The first half of this review has a more tutorial style and discusses the basics of supernova remnant physics and X-ray spectroscopy of the hot plasmas they contain. This includes hydrodynamics, shock heating, thermal conduction, radiation processes, non-equilibrium ionization, He-like ion triplet lines, and cosmic ray acceleration. The second half offers a review of the advances made in field of X-ray spectroscopy of supernova remnants during the last 15 year. This period coincides with the availability of X-ray imaging spectrometers. In addition, I discuss the results of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Chandra and XMM-Newton gratings. Although these instruments are not ideal for studying extended sources, they nevertheless provided interesting results for a limited number of remnants. These results provide a glimpse of what may be achieved with future microcalorimeters that will be available on board future X-ray observatories. In discussing the results of the last 15 years I have chosen to discuss a few topics that are of particular interest. These include the properties of Type Ia supernova remnants, which appear to be regularly shaped and have stratified ejecta, in contrast to core collapse supernova remnants, which have patchy ejecta distributions. For core collapse supernova remnants I discuss the spatial distribution of fresh nucleosynthesis products, but also their properties in connection to the neutron stars they contain. For the mature supernova remnants I focus on the prototypal supernova remnants Vela and the Cygnus Loop. And I discuss the interesting class of mixed-morphology remnants. Many of these mature supernova remnants contain still plasma with enhanced ejecta abundances. Over the last five years it has also become clear that many mixed-morphology remnants contain plasma that is overionized. This is in contrast to most other supernova remnants, which contain underionized plasmas. This text ends with a review of X-ray synchrotron radiation from shock regions, which has made it clear that some form of magnetic-field amplification is operating near shocks, and is an indication of efficient cosmic-ray acceleration.},

  Abstract                 = {I report here on the analysis and interpretation of a Chandra observation of the supernova remnant Kes 32. Kes 32 is rather weak in X-rays because of a large interstellar absorption, which is found to be ~4×1022 cm-2, larger than previously reported. Spectral analysis indicates that the ionization age of this object is very young, with net~4×109 cm-3 s and a temperature of kTe~1 keV. The X-ray emission peaks at a smaller radius than in the radio. The low ionization age suggests that Kes 32 is a young remnant. However, a young age is in contradiction to the relatively large apparent size, which indicates an age of several thousand years instead of a few hundred years. This problem is discussed in connection with Kes 32's unknown distance and its possible association with the Norma Galactic arm.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims: We develop a set of diagnostic tools for synchrotron-emitting sources, presented in a previous paper, to include a computation of inverse-Compton radiation from the same relativistic particles that give rise to the synchrotron emission. For the first time, we then study the gamma-ray emission properties of Pulsar Wind Nebulae, in the context of the axisymmetric jet-torus scenario. Methods: We evolve the relativistic MHD equations and the maximum energy of the emitting particles, including adiabatic and synchrotron losses along streamlines. The particle energy distribution function is split into two components: one corresponds to radio-emitting electrons, which are interpreted to be a relic population that is born at the outburst of the supernova, and the other is associated with a wind population that is continuously accelerated at the termination shock and emits up to the gamma-ray band. The inverse Compton emissivity is calculated using the general Klein-Nishina differential cross-section and three different photon targets for the relativistic particles are considered: the nebular synchrotron photons, photons associated with the far-infrared thermal excess, and the cosmic microwave background. Results: When the method is applied to the simulations that match the optical and X-ray morphology of the Crab Nebula, the overall synchrotron spectrum can only be fitted assuming an excess of injected particles and a steeper power law (E-2.7) with respect to previous models. The resulting TeV emission has then the correct shape but is in excess of the data. This is related to the magnetic-field structure in the nebula, derived using simulations: in particular, the field is strongly compressed close to the termination shock, but with a lower than expected volume average. The jet-torus structure is also found to be visible clearly in high-resolution gamma-ray synthetic maps. We present a preliminary exploration of time variability in X- and gamma-rays. We find variations with timescales of about 2 years in both bands. The variability observed originates in the strongly time-dependent MHD motions inside the nebula.

Although, in general, red clump stars are considered as standard candles, they do not exactly stay in a narrow range of absolute magnitude, but may have a range of more than one magnitude depending on their initial mass. Consequently, conventional oversimplified distance estimations with the assumption of a fixed luminosity may lead to systematic bias related to the initial mass or age, which can potentially affect the study of the evolution of the Galaxy with red clump stars. We therefore employ an isochrone-based method to estimate the absolute magnitude of red clump stars from their observed surface gravities, effective temperatures and metallicities. We verify that the estimation removes the systematics well and provides initial mass/age estimates that are independent of distance with accuracy better than 10%.},

  Abstract                 = {Two main physical mechanisms are used to explain supernova explosions: thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf(Type Ia) and core collapse of a massive star (Type II and Type Ib/Ic). Type Ia supernovae serve as distance indicators that led to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe. The exact nature of their progenitor systems however remain unclear. Radio emission from the interaction between the explosion shock front and its surrounding CSM or ISM provides an important probe into the progenitor star's last evolutionary stage. No radio emission has yet been detected from Type Ia supernovae by current telescopes. The SKA will hopefully detect radio emission from Type Ia supernovae due to its much better sensitivity and resolution. There is a 'supernovae rate problem' for the core collapse supernovae because the optically dim ones are missed due to being intrinsically faint and/or due to dust obscuration. A number of dust-enshrouded optically hidden supernovae should be discovered via SKA1-MID/survey, especially for those located in the innermost regions of their host galaxies. Meanwhile, the detection of intrinsically dim SNe will also benefit from SKA1. The detection rate will provide unique information about the current star formation rate and the initial mass function. A supernova explosion triggers a shock wave which expels and heats the surrounding CSM and ISM, and forms a supernova remnant (SNR). It is expected that more SNRs will be discovered by the SKA. This may decrease the discrepancy between the expected and observed numbers of SNRs. Several SNRs have been confirmed to accelerate protons, the main component of cosmic rays, to very high energy by their shocks. This brings us hope of solving the Galactic cosmic ray origin's puzzle by combining the low frequency (SKA) and very high frequency (Cherenkov Telescope Array: CTA) bands' observations of SNRs.},

Here I present excitation calculations which show that when the OH column density exceeds 1017cm-2 at similar densities and temperatures, the inversion of the 1720 MHz line switches off and instead the 6049 MHz transition in the first excited rotational state of OH becomes inverted. This line may serve as a complementary signal of warm, shocked gas when the OH column density is large.},

I consider the effect of this dissociating flux on the oxygen chemistry in C-type shocks. Typically, a few percent of the water molecules produced within the shock front are dissociated before the gas has cooled to 50 K. The resulting column density of warm OH rises from 1015 to 1016 cm-2 as the ionization rate is increased from 10-17 s-1 (typical of dark clouds) to 10-15 s-1 (adjacent to supernova remnants). These column densities produce substantial emission in the far-infrared rotational transitions of OH and are consistent with the OH/H2O ratios inferred from Infrared Space Observatory observations of emission from molecular shocks. For high ionization rates, the column of warm OH is sufficient to explain the OH(1720 MHz) masers that occur where molecular clouds are being shocked by supernova remnants. The predicted abundance of OH throughout the shock front will enable C-type shocks to be examined with high spectral resolution through radio observations of the four hyperfine ground-state transitions of OH at 18 cm and heterodyne measurements of emission in the far-infrared (e.g., from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy).},

In an effort to understand the connection between the morphology of SNRs and the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), we have examined the radio images of all known SNRs in our Galaxy and compiled a large sample that have an axisymmetric morphology, which we define to mean SNRs with a bilateral or barrel-shaped morphology, in addition to one-sided shells. We selected the cleanest examples and model each of these at their appropriate Galactic position using two GMF models, one of which includes a vertical halo component, and another that is oriented entirely parallel to the plane. Since the magnitude and relative orientation of the magnetic field changes with distance from the sun, we analyze a range of distances, from 0.5 to 10 kpc in each case. Using a physically motivated model of an SNR expanding into an ambient GMF that includes a vertical halo component, we find it is able to reproduce observed morphologies of many SNRs in our sample. These results strongly support the presence of an off-plane, vertical component to the GMF, and the importance of the Galactic field on SNR morphology.

For the whole nebula, the huge number of recorded counts allows a detailed examination of the soft X-ray absorption due to cool gas in the foreground of the Crab. Absorption edges due to oxygen and neon are clearly identified. Oxygen and iron in the interstellar medium are underabundant by a factor of 0.63 +/- 0.01. The average N_H=3.45+/-0.02 1021 cm-2 and varies by less than +/-11% on a scale equal to or larger than 20 arcsec over the face of the nebula.

CCD images from three epochs spanning a period of 11 yr are used: 1987 from Las Campanas and 1991 and 1998 from Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The filaments in SN 1006 are nonradiative, appearing only in the Balmer lines of hydrogen. Delicate filaments-probably thin sheets seen in projection-delineate the shock front along the northwestern rim of the remnant. We use the center of curvature of the filaments to define a convenient geometry and integrate along short segments to obtain one-dimensional profiles. These remain unchanged, within seeing and statistical errors, from one epoch to another. Measuring the shift in a direction perpendicular to the filaments, we obtain proper motions of 280+/-8 mas yr-1 along the entire length where the filaments are well defined, with little systematic variation along the filaments. In addition to the measurements of the well-defined filaments in the northwest of SN 1006, we also report very deep Hα imaging observations of the entire remnant that clearly show very faint emission surrounding almost the entire shell, as well as some diffuse emission regions in the (projected) interior. Combining the proper-motion measurement with a recent measurement of the shock velocity based on spectra of the same filaments by Ghavamian et al. leads to a distance of 2.18+/-0.08kpc to SN 1006. Several lines of argument suggest that SN 1006 was a Type Ia event, so the improved distance measurement can be combined with the peak luminosity for SNe Ia, as recently determined for events in galaxies with Cepheid-based distances, to calculate the apparent brightness of the spectacular event that drew wide attention in the 11th century. The result, Vmax=-7.5+/-0.4, lies squarely in the middle of the wide range of estimates based on the historical observations.},

No evidence of such emission was discovered above the background noise in any of the observations. We have developed a radiative transfer water maser model for the shocked regions of supernova remnants in order to determine why this emission was not detected. The model indicates an insignificant amount of 22.235-GHz gain; the gain lengths are far too short to allow the formation of detectable water masers from these objects. We predict that only in unusual environments can 22-GHz water masers be detected around supernova remnants.},

  Abstract                 = {The nucleosynthetic yield of isotopes lighter than A = 66 (zinc) is determined for a grid of stellar masses and metallicities including stars of 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, and 40 Msun and metallicities Z = 0, l0-4, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 times solar (a slightly reduced mass grid is employed for nonsolar metallicities). Altogether 78 different model supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity (typically 1.2 × 1051 ergs), and the explosive modifications to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined. A single value of the critical 12C(α,γ) 16O reaction rate corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations. The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant is also determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a "mass cut" farther out. This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy in more massive stars, it appears likely that stars larger than about 30 Msun will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail, they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because of their more compact structure and reduced mass loss.},

  Abstract                 = {We have performed submillimeter and millimeter observations in CO lines toward supernova remnant (SNR) IC443. The CO molecular shell coincides well with the partial shell of the SNR detected in radio continuum observations. Broad emission lines and three 1720 MHz OH masers were detected in the CO molecular shell. The present observations have provided further evidence in support of the interaction between the SNR and the adjoining molecular clouds (MCs). The total mass of the MCs is 9.26 × 103 M sun. The integrated CO line intensity ratio (R_{I_CO(3-2)/I_CO(2-1)}) for the whole MC is between 0.79 and 3.40. The average value is 1.58, which is much higher than previous measurements of individual Galactic MCs. Higher line ratios imply that shocks have driven into the MCs. We conclude that high R_{I_CO(3-2)/I_CO(2-1)} is identified as a good signature of the SNR-MC interacting system. Based on the IRAS Point Source Catalog and the Two Micron All Sky Survey near-infrared database, 12 protostellar object and 1666 young stellar object (YSO) candidates (including 154 classical T Tauri stars and 419 Herbig Ae/Be stars) are selected. In the interacting regions, the significant enhancement of the number of protostellar objects and YSOs indicates the presence of some recently formed stars. After comparing the characteristic timescales of star formation with the age of IC443, we conclude that the protostellar objects and YSO candidates are not triggered by IC443. For the age of the stellar winds shell, we have performed our calculation on the basis of a stellar wind shell expansion model. The results and analysis suggest that the formation of these stars may be triggered by the stellar winds of the IC443 progenitor.},

The distance to G59.7+0.1 is smaller than its near kinematic distance and places it between the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus spiral arms, probably in the Local (Orion) spur. The distance to W 51 IRS2, while subject to significant uncertainty, is close to its kinematic distance and places it near the tangent point of the Carina-Sagittarius arm. It also agrees well with a recent estimate based on O-type star spectro/photometry. Combining the distances and proper motions with observed radial velocities gives the full space motions of the star-forming regions. We find modest deviations of 5-10 km s-1 from circular Galactic orbits for these sources, both counter to Galactic rotation and toward the Galactic center.},

  Abstract                 = {Supernovae near the Galactic center (GC) evolve differently from regular Galactic supernovae. This is mainly due to the environment into which the supernova remnants (SNRs) propagate. SNRs near the GC propagate into a wind swept environment with a velocity directed away from the GC, and a graded density profile. This causes these SNRs to be non-spherical, and to evolve faster than their Galactic counterparts. We develop an analytic theory for the evolution of explosions within a stellar wind, and verify it using a hydrodynamic code. We show that such explosions can evolve in one of three possible morphologies. Using these results we discuss the association between the two SNRs (SGR East and SGR A’s bipolar radio/X-ray lobes) and the two neutron stars (the Cannonball and SGR J1745-2900) near the GC. We show that, given the morphologies of the SNR and positions of the neutron stars, the only possible association is between SGR A’s bipolar radio/X-ray lobes and SGR J1745-2900. If a compact object was created in the explosion of SGR East, it remains undetected, and the SNR of the supernova that created the Cannonball has already disappeared.},

  Abstract                 = {Although collisionless shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, certain key aspects of them are not well understood. In particular, the process known as collisionless electron heating, whereby electrons are rapidly energized at the shock front, is one of the main open issues in shock physics. Here, we present the first clear evidence for efficient collisionless electron heating at the reverse shock of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR), revealed by Fe K diagnostics using high-quality X-ray data obtained by the Suzaku satellite. We detect Kβ (3p → 1s) fluorescence emission from low-ionization Fe ejecta excited by energetic thermal electrons at the reverse shock front, which peaks at a smaller radius than Fe Kα (2p → 1s) emission dominated by a relatively highly ionized component. Comparisons with our hydrodynamical simulations imply instantaneous electron heating to a temperature 1000 times higher than expected from Coulomb collisions alone. The unique environment of the reverse shock, which is propagating with a high Mach number into rarefied ejecta with a low magnetic field strength, puts strong constraints on the physical mechanism responsible for this heating and favors a cross-shock potential created by charge deflection at the shock front. Our sensitive observation also reveals that the reverse shock radius of this SNR is about 10% smaller than the previous measurement using the Fe Kα morphology from the Chandra observations. Since strong Fe Kβ fluorescence is expected only from low-ionization plasma where Fe ions still have many 3p electrons, this feature is key to diagnosing the plasma state and distribution of the immediate postshock ejecta in a young SNR.},

  Abstract                 = { Aims: Two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used to model the emission properties of TeV-bright shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) and to explore their nature. Methods: In the leptonic scenario for the TeV emission, the γ-ray emission is produced via inverse Compton scattering of background soft photons by high-energy electrons accelerated by the shocks of the SNRs. In a previous paper, we showed that since the energy densities of the cosmic microwave background radiation and that of the IR/optical background photons are much higher than that of the photons produced by the same high-energy electrons via the synchrotron process, the observed correlation between X-ray and TeV brightness of SNR RX J1713.7-3946 can be readily explained with the assumption that the energy density of relativistic electrons is proportional to that of the magnetic field. The TeV emissivity is therefore proportional to the magnetic field energy density and MHD simulations can be used to model the TeV structure of such remnants directly. Two-dimensional MHD simulations for SNRs are then performed under the assumption that the ambient interstellar medium is turbulent with the magnetic field and density fluctuations, following a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum. Results: (1) As expected, these simulations confirm early 1D and 2D modelings of these sources, namely the hydrodynamical evolution of the shock waves and amplification of magnetic field by Rayleigh-Taylor convective flows and by shocks propagating in a turbulent medium; (2) we reproduce rather complex morphological structure for γ-rays, for example, the bright thin rim and significant asymmetry, suggesting intrinsic variations of the source morphology not related to the structure of the progenitor and environment; and (3) the observed radial profile of several remnants are well reproduced with an ambient medium density of 0.1-1 cm-3. An even lower ambient density leads to a sharper drop of the TeV brightness with radius than what is observed near the outer edge of these remnants. Conclusions: In a turbulent background medium, we can reproduce the observed characteristics of several shell-type TeV SNRs with reasonable parameters except for a higher ambient density than that inferred from X-ray observations.},

  Abstract                 = {The Fermi bubbles are among the most important findings of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope; however, their origin is still elusive. One of the unique features of the bubbles is that their gamma-ray spectrum, including a high-energy cutoff at ˜110 GeV and the overall shape of the spectrum, is nearly spatially uniform. The high-energy spectral cutoff is suggestive of a leptonic origin due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons; however, even for a leptonic model, it is not obvious why the spectrum should be spatially uniform. In this work, we investigate the bubble formation in the leptonic active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet scenario using a new CRSPEC module in FLASH that allows us to track the evolution of a CR spectrum during the simulations. We show that the high-energy cutoff is caused by fast electron cooling near the Galactic center (GC) when the jets were launched. Afterwards, the dynamical timescale becomes the shortest among all relevant timescales, and therefore the spectrum is essentially advected with only mild cooling losses. This could explain why the bubble spectrum is nearly spatially uniform: the CRs from different parts of the bubbles as seen today all share the same origin near the GC at an early stage of the bubble expansion. We find that the predicted CR spatial and spectral distribution can simultaneously match the normalization, spectral shape, and high-energy cutoff of the observed gamma-ray spectrum and their spatial uniformity, suggesting that past AGN jet activity is a likely mechanism for the formation of the Fermi bubbles.},

We discuss the dynamics of their H I environment and a possible relationship of these SNRs with each other. We discovered patches of H I emission surrounding G114.3+0.3 indicating a location in the Local arm at a distance of about 700 pc, in contrast to previous publications, which proposed a Perseus arm location. The other two SNRs have radial velocities of -17 km s-1 (G116.5+1.1) and -27 km s-1 (CTB 1) according to related H I. However, the structure of the H I and its dynamics in velocity space suggest a possible relation between them, placing both remnants at a distance of about 1.6 kpc. CTB 1 appears to be embedded in an H I feature that is moving as a whole toward us with a velocity of about 10 km s-1. Furthermore, the off-centered location of CTB 1 in a large H I bubble indicates that the so-called breakout region of the remnant is in fact due to its expansion toward the low-density interior of this bubble. We believe that the progenitor star of CTB 1 was an early B- or O-type star shaping its environment with a strong stellar wind, in which case it exploded in a Ib or Ic event.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the analysis of two deep XMM-Newton observations of the magnetar Swift J1834.9‑0846 and its surrounding extended emission taken in 2014 March and October, 2.5 and 3.1 yr after the source went into outburst. The magnetar is only weakly detected in the first observation, with an absorption-corrected flux {F}0.5-10{keV}≈ 4× {10}-14 erg s‑1 cm‑2 and a 3σ upper limit during the second observation of about 3 × 10‑14 erg s‑1 cm‑2. This flux level is more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the flux measured at the outburst onset in 2011 September. The extended emission, centered at the magnetar position and elongated toward the southwest, is clearly seen in both observations; it is best fit by a highly absorbed power law (PL), with a hydrogen column density of {N}{{H}}=8.0× {10}22 cm‑2 and PL photon index {{Γ }}=2.2+/- 0.2. Its flux is constant between the two observations at {F}0.5-10{keV}=1.3× {10}-12 erg s‑1 cm‑2. We find no statistically significant changes in the spectral shape or the flux of this extended emission over a period of 9 yr from 2005 to 2014. These new results strongly support the extended emission nature as a wind nebula and firmly establish Swift J1834.9‑0846 as the first magnetar to show a surrounding wind nebula. Further, our results imply that such nebulae are no longer exclusive to rotation-powered pulsars and narrow the gap between these two subpopulations of isolated neutron stars. The size and spectrum of the nebula are compatible with those of pulsar-wind nebulae, but its radiative efficiency {η }{{X}}={L}{{X}}/\dot{E}≈ 0.1 is markedly high, possibly pointing to an additional wind component in Swift J1834.9‑0846.},

Several runs were carried out with different values for the mass-loss rate of the jet, the initial radius of the SNR, and the opening angle of the precession cone. We found that our models successfully reproduce the scale and morphology of W50 when the opening angle of the jets is set to 10° or if this angle linearly varies with time. For these models, more realistic runs were made considering that the remnant is expanding into an interstellar medium with an exponential density profile (as HI observations suggest). Taking into account all these ingredients, the large-scale morphology of the W50-SS433 system, including the asymmetry between the lobes (formed by the jet-SNR interaction), is well reproduced.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decade, considerable effort has been made to measure the proper motions of the pulsars B1757-24 and B1951+32 in order to establish or refute associations with nearby supernova remnants and to understand better the complicated geometries of their surrounding nebulae. We present proper motion measurements of both pulsars with the Very Large Array, increasing the time baselines of the measurements from 3.9 yr to 6.5 yr and from 12.0 yr to 14.5 yr, respectively, compared to previous observations. We confirm the nondetection of proper motion of PSR B1757-24, and our measurement of (μα,μδ) = (- 11 +/- 9, - 1 +/- 15) mas yr-1 confirms that the association of PSR B1757-24 with SNR G5.4-1.2 is unlikely for the pulsar characteristic age of 15.5 kyr, although an association cannot be excluded for a significantly larger age. For PSR B1951+32, we measure a proper motion of (μα,μδ) = (- 28.8 +/- 0.9, - 14.7 +/- 0.9) mas yr-1, reducing the uncertainty in the proper motion by a factor of 2 compared to previous results. After correcting to the local standard of rest, the proper motion indicates a kinetic age of ~51 kyr for the pulsar, assuming it was born near the geometric center of the supernova remnant. The radio-bright arc of emission along the pulsar proper motion vector shows time-variable structure, but moves with the pulsar at an approximately constant separation ~2.5'', lending weight to its interpretation as a shock structure driven by the pulsar.},

  Abstract                 = {We model a time-dependent nonthermal particle and photon spectra for young SNRs by assuming diffusive shock acceleration of the nonthermal particles and address a possible hadronic contribution of TeV γ-ray emission. In this model, the nonthermal electron and proton spectra, and then multiwavelength photon spectra that originated from both the electrons and the protons at different ages of the SNRs, are calculated respectively; the photon spectrum from radio to X-ray bands is dominated by synchrotron radiation of the relativistic electrons, and TeV γ-rays are produced by electron bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and the π0 decay due to the relativistic protons colliding with ambient medium. Our results indicate that the relative importance of the hadronic origin of TeV γ-rays depends on the ratio of accelerated electrons to protons at the source, and the hadronic origin of TeV γ-rays can dominate the bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton processes of the relativistic electrons for young SNRs when a reasonable value of the ratio of the electrons to the protons at the source is used. The model is applied to three young SNRs, RX J1713.7-3946, SN 1006, and RX J0852.0-4622 our model results can explain the multiwavelength photon spectra for the three SNRs and show that the high-energy γ-rays from RX J1713.7-3946 and RX J0852.0-4622 may have hadronic origins.},

This new edge is identified and overlaps with W51A along the line of sight, which gives a new angular diameter of about 37‧ for the quasi-circular remnant. In addition, we assemble the OH spectral lines (1612/1665/1720 MHz) toward the complex by employing the newly released THOR (The HI OH Recombination line survey of Milky Way) data. We find that the known 1720 MHz OH maser in the W51B/C overlap area is located away from the detected 1612/1665 MHz absorption region.

Taking the stellar wind into consideration, we can explain the radio morphologies of many SNRs. The directions of the kinematic velocity of the progenitor, the magnetic field, and the line of sight are the most important factors influencing the morphologies. If the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the simulation will give us two different unilateral SNRs and a bilateral symmetric SNR. If the velocity is parallel to the magnetic field, we obtain a bilateral asymmetric SNR and a quasi-circular SNR. Our simulations show the stellar wind plays a key role in the radio evolution of an SNR, which implies that the Galactic global density and magnetic field distribution play a secondary role.},

We derive an average ratio of &#12296;NH/AV&#12297; = (2.08 ± 0.02) × 1021 H cm-2 mag-1 for the whole Galaxy. We find no correlation between &#12296;NH/AV&#12297; and the number density of hydrogen, the distance away from the Galactic Centre and the distance above or below the Galactic plane. The &#12296;NH/AV&#12297; ratio is generally invariant across the Galaxy, with &#12296;NH/AV&#12297; = (2.04 ± 0.05) × 1021 H cm-2 mag-1 for the first and fourth Galactic quadrants and &#12296;NH/AV&#12297; = (2.09 ± 0.03) × 1021 H cm-2 mag-1 for the second and third Galactic quadrants. We also explore the distribution of hydrogen in the Galaxy by enlarging our sample with additional 74 supernova remnants for which both NH and distances are known. We find that, between the Galactic radius of 2 and 10 kpc, the vertical distribution of hydrogen can be roughly described by a Gaussian function with a scaleheight of h = 75.5 ± 12.4 pc and a mid-plane density of nH(0) = 1.11 ± 0.15 cm-3, corresponding to a total gas surface density of ∑gas ˜ 7.0 M⊙ pc-2. We also compile NH from 19 supernova remnants and 29 X-ray binaries for which NH was determined with subsolar abundances. We obtain &#12296;NH/AV&#12297; = (2.47 ± 0.04) × 1021 H cm-2 mag-1 which exceeds that derived with solar abundances by ˜20 per cent.

The new distance of SNR G35.6-0.4 and the derived mass for the ~55 km s-1 CO molecular cloud can accommodate an association with HESS J1858+020.

Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph low resolution data of W49B shows shocked excitation lines of H2 (0,0) S(0)-S(7) from the SNR-molecular cloud interaction. The H2 gas is composed of two components with temperatures of ~260 K and ~1060 K, respectively. Various spectral lines from atomic and ionic particles are detected toward W49B. We suggest that the ionic phase has an electron density of ~500 cm-3 and a temperature of ~104 K by the spectral line diagnoses. The mid- and far-infrared data from MSX, Spitzer, and Herschel reveal a 151 ± 20 K hot dust component with a mass of 7.5 ± 6.6 × 10-4 M ⊙ and a 45 ± 4 K warm dust component with a mass of 6.4 ± 3.2 M ⊙. The hot dust is likely from materials swept up by the shock of W49B. The warm dust may possibly originate from the evaporation of clouds interacting with W49B. We build the H I absorption spectra of W49B and four nearby H II regions (W49A, G42.90+0.58, G42.43-0.26, and G43.19-0.53) and study the relation between W49B and the surrounding molecular clouds by employing the 2.12 μm infrared and CO data. We therefore obtain a kinematic distance of ~10 kpc for W49B and suggest that the remnant is likely associated with the CO cloud at about 40 km s-1.},

  abstract = {The strong shocks in young supernova remnants (SNRs) should accelerate cosmic rays (CRs), and there is no doubt that relativistic electrons are produced in SNRs. However, direct and convincing evidence that SNRs produce CR nuclei has not yet been obtained and may, in fact, be long in coming if current γ-ray observatories do not see an unambiguous pion-decay feature. Nevertheless, the lack of an observed pion-decay feature does not necessarily mean that CR ions are not abundantly produced since ions do not radiate efficiently. If CR ions are produced efficiently by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), their presence will modify the hydrodynamics of the SNR and produce morphological effects that can be clearly seen in radiation produced by electrons. We describe in some detail our CR-hydro model, which couples DSA with the remnant hydrodynamics, and the synchrotron emission expected for two distinct parameter sets representing Type Ia and Type II supernovae. Several morphological features emerge in radial profiles, including the forward shock precursor, which are observable with current X-ray observatories and should definitively show whether young SNRs produce CR ions efficiently or not. For the specific case of SN 1006 we conclude, as have others, that the extremely short X-ray scale heights observed near the outer shock argue convincingly for the efficient production of CR ions.},

  abstract      = {For the case of Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR) we present the relation between the blast wave and contact discontinuity radii calculated within the nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in SNRs. It is demonstrated that these radii are confirmed by recently published Chandra measurements which show that the observed contact discontinuity radius is so close to the shock radius that it can only be explained by efficient CR acceleration which in turn makes the medium more compressible. Together with the recently determined new value E sn=1.2×1051 erg of the SN explosion energy this also confirms our previous conclusion that a TeV γ-ray flux of (2 5)×10-13 erg/(cm2 s) is to be expected from Tycho’s SNR. Chandra measurements and the HEGRA upper limit of the TeV γ-ray flux together limit the source distance d to 3.3≤d≤4 kpc.},

  abstract      = {We quantify the effects of magnetic fields, cosmic rays and gas pressure on the rotational velocity of H I gas in the Milky Way, at Galactocentric distances between R⊙ and 2 R⊙. The magnetic field is modelled by two components: a mainly azimuthal magnetic component and a small-scale tangled field. We construct a range of plausible axisymmetric models consistent with the strength of the total magnetic field as inferred from radio synchrotron data. In a realistic Galactic disc, the pressure by turbulent motions, cosmic rays and the tangled turbulent field provides radial support to the disc. Large-scale (ordered) magnetic fields may or may not provide support to the disc, depending on the local radial gradient of the azimuthal field. We show that for observationally constrained models, magnetic forces cannot appreciably alter the tangential velocity of H I gas within a galactic distance of 2 R⊙.},
